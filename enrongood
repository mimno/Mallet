go
florida!

they
shit
their
pants
this
weekend

Matt-


Hey
there!

Have
you
recovered
from
the
Big
Bash
yet??

Heard
you
put
on
a
kickass
party..I
heard
ALL
the
details.:)

Anyway

as
it
is
now
close
to
January
Max
wants
me
to
send
an
email
to
you
to
pass
on
to
all
the
ushers
(Peder
Ryan
Scott
&

Merlin)
since
you
have
their
email
addresses
Florida
in
January
is
pretty
busy
so
you
definately
want
to
book
your
hotel
reservations
NOW..you
don't
need
a
deposit
yet
I
don't
think
you
just
need
to
hold
a
room

Here
is
the
info
on
the
hotel
where
everyone
is
staying
(where
we
got
group
rates)
also
this
is
where
the
Rehearsal
Dinner
&
the
Sunday
brunch
are..the
wedding
is
down
the
street
so
you
guys
may
just
want
one
rental
car
for
all
of
you

I
think
Thursday
afternoon

is
when
you
will
all
go
to
the
Tux
place
in
North
Miami
to
try
on
your
tuxes
&
make
sure
that
the
measurments
are
right
when
they
still
have
enough
time
to
make
any
adjustments

Friday
during
the
day
Max
will
have
something
planned
for
you
guys..

Please
start
getting
your
measurements
now
&
we
will
send
you
another
email
when
we
find
the
place
for
you
to
call
in
your
measurements
in
Miami

Call
with
any
questions
(303)
832-8160...The
hotties
in
Miami
are
waiting
for
you..

The
Miami
Beach
Ocean
Resort
3025
Collins
Avenue
Miami
Beach
1-800-550-0505

*Say
you
are
with
the
Harris/Schrutt
wedding
for
group
rates
of:
$160/night
-
city
view





$200/night
-
ocean
view

If
you
need
a
travel
agent
we
have
used
June
Schram
with
Young
Travel
previously
at
1-800-426-9968
&
again

say
you
are
with
our
wedding
party..

Take
care
&
be
safe....Jen

i
will
be
in
vegas

send
her
my
regards

i
think
the
best
guy
to
contact
is
a
guy
named
ted
bland
or
karen
buckley

i
think
he
heads
up
the
trading
track
program

this
is
the
best
way
to
get
into
trading
now

you
have
to
do
3
6mo
rotations
in
different
trading
support
roles

contact
him
and
he
should
be
able
to
get
you
more
info

hope
that
helps
you
out

lsu

then
went

**********************************************************************

it
is
so
good
to
finally
get
one
of
these
state
of
the
unions
again

i
don=
't
know
if
i
can
speak
for
everyone
but
i
sure
have
missed
it



it
is
ju=
st
good
to
read
all
the
smart
witty
humor
again

i
especially
thought
the=

part
about
screaming
"who
let
the
dogs
out"
was
quite
funny

it
makes
it
=
especially
funny
b/c
the
employees
play
along
instead
of
yelling
out
"shut
=
up
nerd"


as
most
of
you
know
chad
and
i
no
longer
live
together

it
was=

real
tough
to
see
him
go
b/c
we
are
pretty
close
but
not
as
close
as
mazi=
arz
and
i
evidently
are

but
every
now
and
then
i
still
get
reminders
that=

i
used
to
live
with
chad

like
the
other
day
when
i
was
vacuming

i
decid=
ed
to
vacum
behind
the
couch
b/c
i
had
never
cleand
back
there

when
i
loo=
ked
behind
the
couch
the
floor
was
littered
with
about
50
toenails



at
f=
irst
i
was
pretty
freaked
out
and
i
was
thinking
how
could
these
toenails
p=
ossibly
get
here?

but
then
i
remembered
i
use
to
live
with
chad
and
he
had=

a
nasty
habit
of
pulling
off
his
toenails

i
should
have
figured
that
he
=
didn't
dispose
of
them
properly

it
is
good
to
see
that
chad
has
figured
o=
ut
how
to
use
the
email
system
again

last
week
enron
sent
out
a
company
w=
ide
email
and
our
boy
chad
replied
back
to
the
whole
company

i
felt
prett=
y
embarrassed
for
him
after
he
sent
the
first
reply
but
went
he
replied
to=

the
whole
company
a
second
time
i
just
thought
that
he
was
an
idiot

now
=
he
will
be
known
as
the
guy
who
replied
not
once
but
twice
to
a
company
wid=
e
email

well
i
sure
am
looking
foward
to
the
next
state
of
the
union

i=

know
i
will
since
i
am
going
to
vegas
to
spend
all
my
money
at
the
strip
c=
lubs

i
cannot
make
it

my
parents
will
be
in
town
this
weekend

We
are
planning
on
doing
Nick's
bachelor
party
this
Friday
night
in
NOLA
He
has
a
wedding
shower
on
Sat
night
and
I
am
trying
to
see
who
all
is
going
to
be
able
to
make
it
I
know
there
has
been
a
lot
of
wedding
stuff
going
on
but
this
is
still
Nick's
turn
and
I
hope
that
if
you
could
be
there
then
you
will
be
there
The
tentative
schedule
is
to
start
off
with
some
Monsoon's
at
Port
of
Call
then
go
to
Harrah's
for
a
little
while
and
eventually
hit
Larry
Flynt's
Hustler
Club
I
need
to
get
an
accurate
count
of
who
is
going
to
make
it
in
Please
send
me
a
response
on
whether
you
will
be
in
attendance
or
not
as
soon
as
possible

that
is
nasty

you
probably
didn't
even
see
it

my
thoughts
exactly...my
boys
said
thanks
for
the
practice

what
game

Hope
you
didn't
drive
all
the
way
to
New
O
to
catch
the
game

:)
H

what
game

Hope
you
didn't
drive
all
the
way
to
New
O
to
catch
the
game

:)
H

i
hope
he
doesn't
publish
this
and
respond
to
it
today

Let
me
start
off
by
saying
YOU
MYOPIC
NEARSIGHTED
LITTLE
FUCK

Have
you
ever
been
to
Tiger
Stadium
on
a
Saturday
night?

Have
you
ever
heard
the
Tiger
Band
from
Tigerland
play
as
the
Tigers
take
the
field?

Were
you
not
there
in
1997
when
we
beat
the
shit
out
of
the
then
ranked
#1
Florida
Gators?

If
you
didn't
write
about
sports
would
you
still
feel
like
a
man?
I
bet
the
answer
to
all
of
these
questions
is
a
resounding
NO

You
never
hear
any
other
columnists
or
coaches
banging
on
other
venues
within
their
conferences
because
of
the
respect
and
pride
they
have
of
their
own
conference

You
don't
deserve
the
SEC
and
you
don't
deserve
to
write
about
it

I
hope
you
are
at
the
game
Saturday
night

Win
or
lose
a
few
things
will
definitely
happen

1)Before
the
game
you
will
get
a
rush
hearing
the
Tiger
band
make
their
way
to
the
stadium

2)You
will
get
a
rush
when
the
Tigers
run
out
on
the
field

3)You
will
hold
your
ears
like
a
pussy
when
you
hear
a
crowd
like
you've
never
heard
before

4)And
lastly
you
will
wish
you
went
to
LSU

since
it

Then

If

that
i
got
a
poodle
but
i
was
just
kidding
about
that
part

i
really
did

chihuahua

i
really
don't
understand
why
you
don't
believe
me
it

you
before?

now
i
know
you

yesterday
the
lie
was
about
a
poodle

you
just
be
honest
with
me?

lies
and
deceit
hurt
me
erin

my
golf
game
sucks

that
is
b/c
i
have
a

swing
after
my

a

this
swing
is
going

i

out
i
will
have
something
to
fall
back
on

it
isn't
oozing
just
itching

it

imaginary

what
is
your
imaginary
friend's
name?

i
got
plenty
of
sleep

my

is
a
perfect

i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
ever
going
to
let
you
see
it
since
you
don't
believe
me

you

trust
me

did
you
get
any
sleep
last

with
your

when

get

this
alleged
dog?

of
those
robotic
dogs

what
is
its
name?

not

you
still

you
don't

i

look

they

in

it
is

Denver
'D'
lacking
on
big-play
front

And
that's
w=
hat's
keeping
the
Denver
Broncos'
defense
from
being
the
dominant
unit
it
w=
as
supposed
to
be
under
new
defensive
coordinator
Ray
Rhodes

Ask
Denver
d=
efenders
to
assess
their
work
three
games
into
the
season
and
inevitably
=
you'll
get
this:
"I
think
we
have
a
chance
to
be
a
very
good
defense
but
w=
e've
got
to
start
making
plays"

i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
not
considering
moving
to
the
denver
office

i
don't
see
myself
in
a
marketing
role
at
this
point
in
my
career

although
this
year
has
been
up
and
down
i
am
enjoying
my
role
on
the
desk

i
think
the
opportunity
that
you
have
given
me
as
a
basis
trader
is
too
good
to
give
up

the
denver
opportunity
was
just
under
consideration
as
an
opportuinity
to
move
back
to
denver

we
can
talk
more
about
it
if
you
would
like
on
monday

As
most
of
you
know
Monique
Sanchez
has
resigned
and
will
be
leaving
Enron
October
12

Monique
is
moving
to
Salt
Lake
City
with
her
fianc?
and
will
be
living
in
Deer
Valley

We
congratulate
Monique
on
her
move
and
thank
her
for
all
of
her
contributions
to
the
west
desk

We
will
plan
a
going
away
dinner
for
Monique
before
she
leaves

boudreaux-

what's
up?

are
you
going
to
the
tenn
game?



hey
give
me
a
call
tonight
at
901-528-0914
it
is

tuesday
the
28th

i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
moving
or
not


i
wont
know
until
the
beginning
of
the
year

i
am
back
and
forth
on
the
decision

i
am
glad
your
sis
is
ok

i
did
get
a
room
for
160

i
am
sure
i
will
split
it
with
some
of
those
guys

Hey
there...thanks
for
your
concern
for
my
friends
&
family
after
the
tragedy..everyone
is
okay
thank
G-d..how
about
your
friends?

I
have
one
sister
in
DC
&
one
in
NYC
so
it
was
a
pretty
traumatic
week
but
everyone
is
okay
&
that
is
what's
important

Alli
(my
sis
in
NYC)
happened
to
be
at
a
meeting
on
Wall
Street
that
morning
so
she
was
2
blocks
away
&
was
covered
in
debris
running
from
the
building
so
she
will
probably
need
therapy
like
the
rest
of
Manhattan!

On
a
happier
note..thanks
for
forwarding
that
email
to
the
ushers..did
you
get
the
$160
rate
with
our
block
of
rooms
when
you
reserved
your
room?
As
far
as
the
tux
goes.when
we
go
to
Miami
in
October
to
finalize
everything
Max
will
send
the
guys
the
form
for
the
tuxes
to
return
your
measurements
to
the
place
in
Miami
&
you
guys
will
go
get
fitted
&
pick
them
up
on
Thurs
afternoon
or
Fri
morning
before
the
wedding...I
dont
know
what
Max
has
planned
for
you
guys
on
Friday..who
are
you
sharing
a
room
with?

:)

Stacey
is
probably
going
stag...just
kidding...

We
went
to
a
wedding
this
weekend
&
watched
the
best
man
make
a
speech
&
Max
&
I
just
cracked
up
because
all
we
could
do
was
picture
your
speech!

I
have
faith
that
you'll
deliver
a
beautiful
speech
right????

Hope
all
is
well
there..when
are
you
moving
here
to
collect
your
"wingman"?

Take
care
Jen
The
Bride
:)

around
4-5pm

What
time
do
you
need
to
be
in
New
Orleans
that
day?

There
will
be
a
ton
of
hot
ass
very
drunk
in

Also
I've
got
a
hot
friend
who
lives
in
Atlanta
that
I'm
thinking
about
flying

see



she
wants
me
to
come
in
for
the
Auburn/Georgia
game
in
Athens
on
Nov
10



they're
taking
a
bus
from
Atlanta

A
blind
guy
on
a
bar
stool
shouts
to
the
bartender
"Hey!
Wanna
hear
a
blonde
joke?"
The
bar
immediately
becomes
absolutely
quiet
In
a
hushed
voice
the
guy
next
to
him
says
"Before
you
tell
that
joke
you
should
know
something"
"The
bartender
is
blond
the
bouncer
is
blond
and
I'm
a
6'
tall
200
pound
blond
with
a
black
belt
in
karate

What's
more
the
guy
sitting
next
to
me
is
6'2"
weighs
225
pounds
and
he's
a
blond
weight
lifter"
He
continues
"The
fella
to
your
right
is
blond
6'5"
and
pushing
300
pounds
and
he's
a
wrestler
Think
about
it
seriously
Mister
You
still
wanna
tell
that
joke?"

The
blind
guy
says
"Nah!
Not
if
I'm
gonna
have
to
explain
it
five
times

the
only
thing
at

is
a
bunch
of
nancy
boys

are
your
friends
trying
to
meet
gay
guys
or
are
they
gay?

I'll
let

Sierra
would
be
fun


My
roommate
and
her
friends
are
going
to
LaStrada...I'm
not
sure
what
is
going
on
there

We'll
have
to
come
up
with
a
costume
if
we
go
out


that
is
probably
what
i
will
end
up
doing

i
need
to
find
some
really
nice
smelling
oil
though

They
have
gay
people
at
LaStada???

J/K
-
I'm
not

why
they

going
there

They
said
that
there
is
a

party

I
think
some
people
are
going

Sierra

I
was
hoping
you'd
be
in
your
chipendale
costume

:)

sierra

packed
with
girls
dressed
like
lil
hookers

home
nap
and

be

Fellas
I'm
pretty
much
having
the
most
difficult
week
of
work
I've
ever
had
so
I
propose
that
we
drink
heavily
Friday
night



I
think
this
is
a
wise
choice
to
ensure
that
our
livers
don't
go
into
shock
due
to
a
lack
of
alcohol
in
our
system

the

don't
need
to
work
at
denny's

you

golf
allowance
though
i
think
i'll
just
get
you
a
membership
somewhere

wouldn't
that
be
better?

let
me
know
so
i
can
arrange
it

of
earnings
and
additional
information
about
the
maze
of
off-balance-sheet
deals
related
to
it
we
now
have
a
lot
more
information
about
the
mess
at
Enron
than
we
had
24
hours
ago
But
we're
not
much
closer
to
understanding
just
what
HAPPENED
to
leave
Enron
in
such
a
mess
-
and
that's
because
the
company's
explanations
of
all
this
continue
to
be
dense
confusing
and
next
to
impossible
to
grasp



Try
this
tidbit
from
the
Form
8-K
Enron
filed
about
the
restatements
Thursday
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission:



"In
addition
Enron's
net
income
is
reduced
for
specific
JEDI
revenues
previously
allocated
to
Chewco
relating
to
the
appreciation
in
value
of
Enron
stock
which
eliminate
upon
consolidation
This
in
effect
reduces
Enron's
share
of
JEDI's
earnings"



Huh?
And
no
it
doesn't
help
you
to
know
that
"Chewco"
is
an
entity
that
wasn't
included
in
Enron's
financial
results
but
which
Enron
now
admits
should
have
been
Or
that
"JEDI"
isn't
a
"Star
Wars"
reference
but
a
limited
partnership
in
which
both
Enron
and
Chewco
had
invested
It's
still
impenetrable



Then
there
are
the
times
when
Enron
just
plain
doesn't
give
enough
information
The
company
says
its
decision
that
Chewco
should
be
included
in
its
results
after
all
"is
based
on
current
information
that
Chewco
did
not
meet
the
accounting
criteria
to
qualify
as
..
unconsolidated.."
Uh
-
okay
WHY
didn't
it
meet
the
criteria
and
why
did
Enron
previously
believe
that
it
did?
Enron
doesn't
say



Finally
Enron
makes
some
assertions
that
just
make
you
scratch
your
head
The
company
says
part
of
the
restatement
of
its
earnings
stems
from
unspecified
"prior-year
proposed
audit
adjustments
and
reclassifications
which
were
determined
to
be
immaterial
in
the
year
originally
proposed"



Hmmm
Beyond
the
fact
that
Enron
doesn't
elaborate
on
the
nature
of
these
"audit
adjustments
and
reclassifications"
or
why
they
were
originally
considered
immaterial
consider
that
according
to
Enron's
own
figures
in
the
8-K
they
add
up
to
a
negative
earnings
impact
of
$87
million
since
1997
That
amount
doesn't
sound
like
any
definition
of
"immaterial"
I've
ever
heard



An
Enron
spokesman
couldn't
immediately
be
reached
for
comment



In
fairness
this
lack
of
clarity
may
be
all
but
inevitable
given
Enron's
Byzantine
structure
which
involves
dealings
with
outside
but
related
entities
that
also
have
third
parties
involved
which
in
one
case
have
a
subsidiary
that
allowed
Enron
to
hedge
the
risks
of
an
investment
and
in
another
case
is
selling
assets
purchased
from
Enron
to
OTHER
entities
in
order
to
finish
paying
Enron
for
the
original
transaction
and
..
you
get
the
idea
It's
next
to
impossible
to
make
clear
because
Enron's
structure
is
just
too
baroque
to
understand
in
the
first
place



The
market
is
plenty
puzzled
by
all
this
even
in
the
wake
of
Enron's
attempt
to
clarify
things
Take
a
look
at
the
company's
drunken-sailor
stock
chart
from
Thursday
After
news
of
the
restatements
hit
Enron
stock
first
jumped
higher
going
as
high
as
$10
a
share
then
soon
dropped
back
to
as
low
as
$840,
as
investors
started
to
digest
the
details
of
the
news
Then
up
again
to
about
$925,
then
down
again
to
its
current
level
of
around
$850.



There's
no
reason
investors
should
be
confused
like
this
There
is
absolutely
no
reason
that
a
reasonably
intelligent
layman
with
an
elementary
working
knowledge
of
corporate
finance
should
be
unable
to
understand
the
regulatory
filings
structure
earnings
and
balance
sheet
of
any
public
company



If
that's
happens
it's
the
company's
fault
not
the
investor's
-
either
because
the
company
hasn't
explained
things
well
enough
or
because
its
structure
is
needlessly
complicated
to
begin
with
If
Enron
wants
to
get
back
the
market's
confidence
fixing
that
problem
one
way
or
the
other
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
