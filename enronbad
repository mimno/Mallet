confidence in the judgment of Enron's senior management and of the upside 
associated with this business," Barone wrote.
His report reiterated a strong buy recommendation and 12-month stock price 
target of $102 a share, with EBS accounting for $25 of that.
One analyst remained skeptical of the content delivery plans.
"Where they go from here is one of things they have to tell the market in a 
convincing fashion," said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who 
raised Enron to accumulate from hold on Thursday.
But he also cut earnings targets for the EBS segment to $8.40/share because 
of the failed Blockbuster deal.
Heady cash-flow projections figured heavily in Enron's guidance for 2001, 
which called for a stock price of $126, of which EBS would account for $40, 
Meade said.
Meade, whose company initiated coverage on Enron in late May 2000, had been 
alone among Enron analysts in keeping a hold rating on the stock.
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey on Monday released a note reiterating his 
buy recommendation with a $99/share price target.
"While the separation from such a high-profile name is disappointing, we do 
not view this as negative," Eassey wrote. "This could in fact actually 
accelerate Enron's content delivery strategy."
Eassey pointed out that Enron and Blockbuster's trial in Seattle, Salt Lake 
City, New York and Portland, Ore., proved Enron can deliver movies on demand.
That gives them a track record to show to potential customers like movie 
studios and other entertainment concerns that want to provide content 
directly through their Web sites, he said.
Enron's stock closed on Thursday at $66.53, up $3.78, compared with its 
52-week range of $59.99 to $90.5626.

USA: Analysts still bullish on Enron broadband unit prospects. 
By C. Bryson Hull 
  
03/15/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
HOUSTON, March 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street took a hard look at Enron Corp.'s 
content delivery plans this week after it ended its video-on-demand deal with 
Blockbuster Inc. , but remained largely unfazed by the failure of the 
flagship deal, analysts said on Thursday.
On balance, most analysts viewed the busted 20-year exclusive agreement as 
disappointing, but by no means a fatal blow to Enron Broadband Services' 
(EBS) budding content delivery segment. 
Most reiterated buy or strong buy ratings for the Houston company and 
maintained bullish earnings targets for the Enron Broadband Services division.
But all are awaiting an indication of how Enron will reconfigure the content 
delivery initiative.
"I think Blockbuster represented kind of an anchor tenant for the broadband 
business, so they have lost a contract that was important," said Jeff 
Dietert, an analyst with Houston investment house Simmons and Co.
Now EBS will have to pursue smaller contracts to make up the loss, which 
could mean a longer road to create as big a book of business, Dietert said.
EBS executives have said they expect to have $1 billion in total contracted 
business by the end of 2001.
CHASING MORE CONTRACTS TO FILL VOID
EBS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Rice on Friday said his 
division is already pursuing deals with content providers to send on-demand 
games, movies, music and television over the Enron network.
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, in a research note released Monday, said 
he still believes Enron will hit the $1 billion mark in 2001.
"Though this announcement is clearly a disappointment we have a great deal of 
confidence in the judgment of Enron's senior management and of the upside 
associated with this business," Barone wrote.
His report reiterated a strong buy recommendation and 12-month stock price 
target of $102 a share, with EBS accounting for $25 of that.

FYI.  Bill Gang of EES Federal Solutions has been working actively with the 
Air Force in California.  I've participated in weekly calls with them in the 
effort to get them energized about DA.  Turns out they're precluded by law 
from lobbying.  But they seem to have other ways of being influential.  I've 
put Scott Govenar in contact with them and he's keeping them in the DA 
Coalition loop.  Bill/Scott is this guy familiar to you?  Bill any 
suggestions on how we might best target them in our efforts to get groups 
energized?  Bill:  Perhaps you could phone Janel Guerrero directly to 
discuss?  Her number is:  713.853.9104 (is that right Janel)?

Thanks - that is what I had assumed.

One of your e-mails was forwarded to me by my people at Edwards AFB.  As the
lead utility counsel for one of the larger purchasers of electricity in the
state, I am obviously very interested in this subject.  Keeping the direct
access option is important to us, not just to keep the state honest on price
shifting between customer classes, but also for reasons of reliability and
power composition.  As a Federal agency, we have a goal to meet on renewable
power, and this will be difficult if not impossible to do if we do not have
some degree of choice in the composition of our electricity.

Things are looking up!  If this passes, we should be in pretty good shape.
Note the part that says we can operate as we wish up to June 1!

Bill
Susan J Mara@ENRON
03/01/2001 06:43 PM

This is an OK bill.  Not well drafted. It's also overly complicated and
proscriptive.

Deletes the offensive part of ABX 1.
It allows anybody to do whatever they want until June 1 (section 2 d)
On June 1,
  - res and small commercial customers can get in a cue and get DA up to
the # of MWs that are added through load growth. (Section 2 e)
  -- Larger customers would pay an exit fee. (section 2 f)
  -- DA customers would be a entrance fee to return to IOU service (Section
2 g)

There is also a confusing section (2 c) that says a retail customer is only
stuck with CDWR for the proportion of power that CDWR provides.  The way it
reads, if CDWR is providing 40% of the IOUs' power, the retail customer can
get DA for 60% of its load.  I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep
track of and ISO will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter)

A conference call and meeting is scheduled with parties tomorrow on this
language.

Will keep you apprised.

Good Morning Jeff,

Catherine is out of the office until Tuesday 3/20/01.  Not wanting to keep 
you waiting for a reply, I thought it best to give you some feedback 
immediately.  

The great majority of CAD's customers in CA are core.  CAD does not knowingly 
terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date. The reasons 
why CAD's customers are turned back to the utility are as follows:

1) Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep,  the customer chooses to 
return to the utility.

2) Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers 
is approximately $300, those customers that have extremely low annual volumes 
are sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC, at the end of their 
contract.  We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the 
utility, and extract enough margin to support them. Currently in the 
California markets (PG&E, SDG&E, & SOCAL) , there exists approximately 50 
customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions, we 
will not choose to renew the contracts.  The expiration dates for these are 
between 5/30/2001 and 2/28/2005.

3) The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their 
contractual expiration date.  As we are all aware, California customers, 
specifically those with either an index or NYMEX product, experienced a large 
swing in their pricing during the past few months.  CAD has been inundated 
with customers requesting to be returned to their LDC.  Although we seek to 
satisfy our customer to the best of our ability,  returning these customers 
to the utility is the LAST thing we want to do!!!!!!!  

The steps we have taken to address this issue is to:
 a) work with customer service/credit to offer extended payment options to 
ease the effect of the increase.
 b) offer to restructure the customer's contract, and reprice the customer on 
a fixed price product; minimizing their risk going forward.
 c) explain to the customer, in more detail, the reasons why this has 
occurred, and how, going forward, the index/NYMEX pricing has eased.  

Should you have additional questions, please reply or call.
-Jim

Greetings:
 
Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether 
we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked 
into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to 
a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two 
different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained 
that the situation would be resolved.  

The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a 
couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot 
of large ("noncore") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff 
in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the 
Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The 
Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now 
concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for 
whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, 
customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.

Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to 
respond to the following:

Have you "stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core 
customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified 
any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing 
natural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or 
intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know

how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate
the natural gas volumes involved
the location of the non-core customer(s)
the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those 
contracts."

There's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is 
linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers 
back to utility service in California.  

Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying 
to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the 
utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've 
expired, etc.  Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:
Sorry to bother you with this, but please see notes below.  I need to find 
out who I can contact to get information on our noncore accounts.  I'm

Paul, Sue and Joseph - 

I wanted to give you all a quick update on the Mike Day invoices.  I have the 
invoice for January and understand from Joseph that he has the invoice for 
the special session which once reviewed, coded and approved Joseph will 
overnight to Houston.  I called Larry Dallman in accounting and Larry 
confirmed that Goodin, MacBride is currently on a Net 7 payment term.  Larry 
said that he could expedite payment for the January and special session 
invoices for same day pay.  Accounting will call me when the checks are ready 
to be picked up and I will fed ex payment to Mr. Day's attention once I have 
the checks.  Larry and I agreed that it would be best to wait to send the 
invoices at one time (this will make it easier for accounting).

Paul - As you and I discussed, I will send an email to Mr. Day once I have 
received the invoices to advise him when to expect payment and I will confirm 
that he should be the recipient once I have the checks.  I'll make sure to 
copy you, Sue and Joseph so we all stay on the same page.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Great points.  Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants 
list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where 
markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity.  

That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about 
what the goal of this "study" would be, which will determine, to a large 
degree, whether we choose to pursue it.  

I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to 
serve one purpose:  to influence the policy decision currently under debate 
"To de-regulate or not."  As such, I wouldn't see issues like "PJM or APX" or 
"competitive default supplier or not," or "divest generation with vesting 
contracts or retain the assets" being the focus.  

That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to 
come in "Round 2," once the initial debate over "deregulate or not" is won.  
To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case 
for the specific, "right" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study 
down, perhaps interminably.  And it seems that time is of the essence in the 
current environment.  In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is 
won--and won rather quickly--debating  implementation may be moot.  Of 
course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on "how to do 
it," but that would not be the emphasis.

In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to 
proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high 
level policy level question of "to deregulate or not," and address 
implementation in a second, or follow up, study.  I think we should try to 
make a call on this swiftly, since the "go/no go" decision would seem to flow 
from resolution of this issue.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff --

It would be helpful to get some feedback prior to starting to deal with the 
fundamental question related to direct access for smaller customers.  I would 
like to know Teece's perspective on the role of government in this 
marketplace.  In addition, I think that the paper must deal with the 
drawbacks of having mixed roles - utility default supply and competitive 
markets.

Greetings:

As I've mentioned, I've been discussing with a group of academics 
(principally from UC Berkeley) the possibility of producing an analysis of 
why it makes sense to move forward toward de-regulation, and makes no sense 
to turn back to command-and-control regulation.  Clearly, we're at a fork in 
the policy road---move forward, or go back.  

I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group.  It's attached.  Please take 
a look.  I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but 
wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it 
would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to 
read.  Few points worth mentioning:

The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with 
LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron.  
List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the 
recent op-ed piece in the WSJ.
The list also includes Hogan and Joskow  and Borenstein.  We could certainly 
exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis.  
However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., "de-regulation 
is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that 
it does not work."  Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the 
"authors" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies 
to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing 
course.  The analysis would not be a debate over "To Poolco, or not to 
Poolco, PJM, etc."  In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could 
offer the added benefit of creating a "Nixon goes to China" scenario.  Please 
take a look at the list of participants.  Again, we can add to and subtract 
from the list.
Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be 
David Teece, Chairman of LECG.)
None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political 
spectrum.  It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and 
strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan).
The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across 
the country to support the project.  This is for two reasons:  1) the more 
diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) 
they are asking for about $1 million to do the study.
If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national 
campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start 
immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. 
nationwide to garner support for the project.

Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile.  Appreciate your 
comments.

 - REAFFIRMING THE CASE FOR ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION.doc

	Steven Greenberg <sgreenberg@realenergy.com>

The Distributed Energy Resources industry won a major battle yesterday.  The 
California Senate Energy and Utilities Committee passed on a 7-0 bipartisan 
vote, Sen. Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this bill, it was as much 
Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff that discriminates against 
DER.  SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus DER bill SBX 35 which is still alive 
and contains many important provisions fro removing additional barriers.  
Yesterday's vote represents a major win because even if the bill ultimately 
does not get enacted, a very important statement has been made by the 
committee.  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their proceedings.
 
The DER community owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the 
Utilities Committee Members and their staffs:
Sen. Bowen (Chair)
Sen. Alarcon
Sen. Battin
Sen. Dunn
Sen. Murray
Sen. Poochigian
Sen. Sher
Sen. Speier
Sen. Vasconcellos
Sen. Vincent
 
Also much thanks to everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on 
this effort.  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, 
government, manufacturing, and real estate communities.
 
Here are the highlights of yesterday's actions:
 
1. For IOU's- No discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, 
2000 and June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.  If you have 
a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until  July 1 2001, to get it 
installed.  
2. DER installed within the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011.
3. The maximum capacity of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site.
4. The DER must have emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB 
established new guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early 
next year.
5. Customers with DER are still required to pay interconnection, public 
purpose charges, and obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources 
energy purchases program.
6. The CPUC shall require the electrical corporations to include non-utility 
owned DER in its planning process.
7. The CPUC is required to establish a firewall so that in the event that the 
implementation of DER results in net costs to the system, those costs stay 
within the customer class.
8. The CPUC shall require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that 
are non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the 
costs.
9. Muni's are required to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold 
public meetings to solicit comment for recommended changes.
Now we have momentum, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do on 
the Assembly side and with Governor's office.  We need the continued 
(increased) support of all of you as we move this forward.

State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected 
Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 

Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying 
electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential 
document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. 
State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging 
$49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers 
figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. 
The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, 
which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of 
lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom 
Hannigan. 
To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much 
California is spending on power purchases. 
Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, 
it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw 
it. 
"I don't think it was a surprise," said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- 
Redding. 
Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, 
analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could 
jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. 
For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education 
programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst 
warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in 
Davis' proposed budget. 
Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit 
rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the 
utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a 
credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans 
to rise. 
"This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect," said Jean Ross, executive 
director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that 
tracks state spending. "Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the 
energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look 
like in the future." 
The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent 
nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest 
day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per 
megawatt hour. 
Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & 
Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. 
"That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time," he 
said. "Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be." 
The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the 
state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if 
generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could 
force up the price the next day. 
But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right 
to know how its money way being spent. 
"People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on," he 
said. "We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces." 
Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have 
filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state 
has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by 
Davis. 
The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated 
only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if 
needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has 
sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional 
money was needed. 
Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 
billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending 
$43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water 
Resources document. 
Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has 
become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a 
house of cards. 
The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is 
supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will 
be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every 
month.

Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov. 
Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in 
June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to 
hear it. Contact the Energy Desk, San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St.,

Energy Boss Says State Summer Blackouts 'Appear Inevitable' 
Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/16/MN20
0965.DTL 
Washington -- The Bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts "appear 
inevitable" in California this summer, but it firmly rebuffed a deal from 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on 
consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham insisted that price controls would make 
shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state. The administration's 
top priority is to prevent blackouts, he said. 
"Let me make one point clear," Abraham told the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. "Any action we take must either help increase supply or 
reduce demand. . . . Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand. In 
fact, in our view, they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis." 
Abraham said electricity shortages in California "will get worse, and 
blackouts this summer appear inevitable." He cited projections of anywhere 
from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer. 
"I'm not saying that people in California don't want lower energy costs," he 
said. "But I know for sure they don't want to be sitting this summer without 
electricity at all. And our goal is to try to avoid that as the primary 
public interest responsibility of this administration." 
Feinstein became the first leading state Democrat to break with Gov. Gray 
Davis in calling for an end to the rate freeze that has kept electricity 
prices low for California consumers, even as soaring wholesale costs have 
driven the state's investor-owned utilities to bankruptcy and now are 
draining the state's budget surplus. 
But Feinstein insisted that the federal government must simultaneously force 
down wholesale prices until ample new power plants come online. 
Feinstein said higher consumer rates would encourage conservation, saying 
that if people just turned off their computers at night, they would save 7 
percent of the state's electricity supply. 
She also said the state, which now is buying electricity for the utilities, 
has already run through $2.7 billion and could spend $10 billion on 
electricity this year. 
"That is gone," Feinstein said. "It doesn't buy a school. It doesn't repair a 
road. It doesn't build the water system many of us believe the state needs." 
The offer came as a compromise with Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith, who 
warned that an "economic and environmental catastrophe" awaits the Western 
states this summer when electricity demand is expected to soar while a 
drought in the Northwest constricts the supply of hydroelectric power. 
Smith's move to embrace price controls, which he had earlier rejected, 
reflected sharply intensifying political pressure on the Bush administration 
to intervene in the electricity market, as Western officials complained 
bitterly yesterday that rising energy prices are forcing layoffs and now 
threaten the region's economy. 
LESSONS OF SUPPLY, DEMAND
"I'm afraid this summer we're going to be in the middle of a dry lakebed 
explaining to very angry farmers and homeowners and former factory workers 
the lessons of supply and demand," said Smith, whose family owns a frozen 
vegetables business. "I don't want to send the wrong signals to the 
marketplace . . . but I'll tell you, the wrong signal is a recession." 
Abraham repeatedly sought to counter criticism that the Bush administration 
is not doing enough to aid the West, citing a letter he sent to Davis 
yesterday that said the White House will not oppose the state's plan to take 
over the investor-owned utilities' transmission lines, despite disagreeing 
with the approach. 
"Regrettably, I think our opposition to price caps has been claimed by some 
to suggest that the administration either does not care about California and 
the West or is doing nothing to help," Abraham said. "That is simply untrue." 
Abraham said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent order to 13 
power suppliers to refund $69 million in January overcharges to the utilities 
would send "a signal that companies that exploit a serious situation aren't 
going to get away with it." 
He also cited expedited federal approvals and waivers for power plants and 
discussions with Mexico to try to increase electricity exports from Baja to 
California. 
But Abraham firmly rejected price caps, saying they "have already been tried 
and already failed" in California when a price ceiling for electricity sales 
into the state was reduced over the past year from $750 a megawatt hour to 
$150. 
RESULTS OF PRICE CAPS
"The lower the price cap was set, the higher average electricity prices 
rose," Abraham said, in part because municipal utilities were exempt. New 
federal price caps would affect just half of the Western electricity market, 
he said, and so would shift supplies from regulated to unregulated markets 
rather than control prices. 
He also said price caps would "almost certainly" reduce sales from Mexico and 
Canada and induce "cheating and circumvention." 
Armed with charts showing huge wholesale price increases over the past year, 
Feinstein expressed her strong disappointment. 
"Oh, Mr. Secretary," Feinstein said, "I was really surprised by the ideologic 
hardness of your statement. I must tell you that." 
She said California will be 5,000 megawatts short of electricity this summer, 
enough power for 5 million homes. "It's a lot of shortness," she said, 
predicting that prices will reach $5,000 a megawatt hour. "What does 
California do about that if it isn't going to get any help to provide that 
stability and reliability over that period of time? . . . All we're asking 
for is help to prevent price-gouging." 
Abraham countered that the administration's position is "common sense." 
"I'm telling you, I think this summer, if California has worse blackouts than 
currently projected, that (price caps) would have been a disservice to the 
people of your state," Abraham said. "If the rest of the West finds the 
Canadian energy providers refusing to sell at the same levels because of 
price caps . . . that's in my judgment an irresponsible carrying out of our 
public responsibilities here." 
In Sacramento, Davis said he was "particularly grateful" for the 
administration's promise not to oppose the state transmission takeover. He 
also said the state would "have just enough power to avoid blackouts" but 
said "federal officials are of a different view." 
Still, the governor continued to urge ''some effort to temper wholesale 
prices."

enough.

Hey, forget football, and Terrell what's-his-name and the demise of the

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn 
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker 
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go 
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy, anyway?  

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.  

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

This email is a follow-up to yesterday's lobbyist conference call and
today's meeting re potential language changes on 60x.  Attached are two sets
of draft amendment language that were discussed today consistent with a
general strategy on the bill that was discussed yesterday.  That strategy,
generally speaking, keys off an expected Calpine meeting with Hertzberg on
Monday, and is as outlined again below.  Comments / concerns with language
and/or general strategy should go to Julee for IEP by Monday COB for
consideration in next steps as mentioned in the action items.

The anticipated approach with the Hertzberg will be:

A) Persuade him that the "California First!" notion as presented in this
bill (and elsewhere) is not a good policy approach and that the bill should
be killed because: it will be interpreted as protectionist by other states
and will lead them to retailiate; it will isolate California from existing
supplies elsewhere that could help serve California loads; it could deny CA
access to new generation built in other states that could help CA; it will
slow CA projects "in the pipeline"; it will undermine existing commercial
arrangements that developers have _with_ California entities from CA
projects in the pipeline, etc.

If this does not happen, then ...

B) Persuade him to change the bill into something else (as in
carrot/incentive and not a stick that increases commercial and development
risks);

if this does not work and he will consider alternate language which does not
disrupt existing arrangements, then ...

C1) Take the more extensive "bulletproof" language, attached as "C1", which
protects any existing commercial arrangements and provides a method to bring
buyers and sellers together via a notice to interested purchasers maintained
by the CEC;

if that does not work and he will consider alternate language on another
approach which will not disrupt existing arrangements, then ...

C2) Take the "offer to negotiate" language, attached as version "C2", which
was the language developed and circulated yesterday (with the addition of
irrigation districts to the list of folks to whom the offer to negotiate is
extended),

and if that doesn't work, then

D) he wants to disrupt existing commercial relationships and he wants to
adopt a protectionist "California First!" policy which we cannot fix or
support.

Enron has some vested interest in this legislation. We own interest in 
FuelCell Energy, Inc. and in a new micro-turbine company (SoloEnergy). At 5 
MW there is not a lot of opportunity for Origination. On the other hand, at 5 
MW it should be easy to permit this stuff and get units on-line in a matter 
of a few weeks. 

This legislation limits the technology by setting very low emissions 
thresholds. Many of the existing micro-turbines are not this clean. This 
legislation also assumes that the DG is at end-used sites. In my experience, 
my small distribution utilities will benefit by installing DG at their 
substations and at other sites throughout their service areas.

The conversation was very positive (Glynn did not know anything about it at 
first, but, looked into it and called Ken back Friday evening).  Glynn said 
they were including the amount owed in their negotiations over the price for 
the transmission assets and said they intended to pay all of their debts, 
including this one, as soon as they get paid.  He said that this weekk would 
be focussed on finalizing a deal for SCE given the threat of bankruptcy; the 
discussions would then turn to PG&E.

Hi Dale:

Please call me to discuss your question.  (415.782.7822)  Customers could try 
to "bypass" the utility, but until Dec. '95 (PUC final policy decision) and 
AB 1890, it was against the law to have direct access, so you may be 
misinterpreting the yellow book just a bit.  There were other forms of 
"bypass" at that time, but DA as we think of it today was illegal.  Give me a 
call and we can try to clear things up (specific references to where in the 
YB you're getting this impression will be helpful).    Glad to talk to you on 
Friday and be happy to talk more if you have any other questions, or desire 
any follow up.  

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, 
        The Yellow Book is in the mail. I read it over the weekend and found 
it to be a very good backgrounder for this whole thing. Thanks for lending it 
to me, and thanks again for your time Friday.
        A followup question: You had told me Friday that the arrival of QF's 
and other non-utility generators, including plants in neighboring states, had 
large customers chomping at the bit for competition, but frustrated because 
the big IOUs still controlled the grid and held the customers captive. But 
the Yellow book said that already some large customers had found ways to 
bypass the IOUs and get direct access/retail wheeling. 
        Could you explain? 
        Thanks, 
        Dale. 
PS - Please don't forget to call Steve Kean to let him know I'll be calling 
him. Thanks. 

Agreed.

The Commission has issued a draft decision in the distributed generation  
proceeding.? It?adopts the Energy Division's program proposals for  load 
control and distributed generation initiatives and?authorizes a total  of 
$137.8 million in funding for these programs, on an annual basis through  
December 31, 2004.

Since the Commission cannot raise electric utility rates until?it  has 
determined that the rate freeze is over, it has decided to include the costs  
of these programs in the utility's distribution revenue requirement, on the  
electric side, and defer consideration of an electric rate increase until 
the  rate freeze ends.? 
?
The three utilities are directed, within 15 days, to file Advice Letters  
increasing their electric distribution revenue requirements, without 
modifying  current rates, to include the authorized program budgets.? In the 
interim,  all program costs?are to?be tracked in balancing accounts, and the  
utilities should establish such accounts for this purpose.? The utilities  
are also?directed to implement these programs, "without delay."

Under the adopted programs, SDG&E will administer a  demand-responsiveness 
pilot program, targeted to reach 5,000 residential  customers in its service 
territory. SCE will administer a similar pilot program,  targeted to 5,000 
small commercial customers. SDG&E and SCE will provide  financial incentives 
to customers who agree to set their thermostats at  pre-specified levels.? 
Through an internet interface, the utility will  monitor and verify actual 
interruption of loads at the customer site and provide  interactive 
information to customers about their electric usage, in order to  encourage 
peak demand reduction.? Within certain parameters, customers will  have the 
flexibility to override the thermostat settings, subject to  pre-specified 
penalties. 

The draft decision would?also authorize a pilot program to provide  
interactive consumption and cost information to small customers, such as  
historical energy bill information, representative energy usage and cost  
information for common appliances, and tariff options. PG&E?is directed  
to?contract with an independent web designer to develop a website that  
provides customer online access to this information.??The  Commission's?goal 
is to reach 10,000 to 15,000 customers in PG&E's  service territory.? The 
program will be targeted to residential customers  with relatively high 
monthly energy consumption, residential customers with  swimming pools, homes 
and small businesses in the San Francisco peninsula or in  Silicon Valley, 
and/or rural residences and small businesses.

The draft decision also proposes to implement a self-generation program  
across all the utility service territories.? Under the program, financial  
incentives will be provided to distributed generation technologies for 
amounts  ranging from $1 - $4 per watt and 30-50% of total project cost, 
depending on the  type of technology used.? There is a table on page 4 of the 
draft decision  which shows the amounts of the incentives.? 

The utilities are required to outsource to independent consultants or  
contractors all program evaluation activities, and are encouraged to 
outsource  as many other aspects of program implementation as possible.? All  
installation of technologies (hardware and software) at customer sites will 
be  done by independent contractors, and not utility personnel.? The 
utilities  are encouraged to coordinate and work closely with local 
governments,  community-based organizations and business associations to 
recruit and contact  interested customers.

Dynegy: Enron a 'Model Competitor'
It doesn't happen very often, so we're noting an apparently spontaneous 
comment from Dynegy Counsel Ed Ross at a FERC Roundtable last week that one 
of his chief competitors, Enron, "has done an excellent job of being 
competitive." He suggested others could look to Enron as a "model competitor. 
They've done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a 
strong physical desk and we don't see any problem with it. I think they have 
set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the 
regulated and unregulated aspects of their business." 
Ross had prefaced the remark, midway through a heated debate on affiliate 
abuses, with the comment that "this is not an industry-wide problem. I 
believe there are good and bad players in the market today." 
Earlier, Enron's Leslie Lawner had invited "all of you to spend the day on 
Enron's trading floor, because I assure you, you will not see a more 
competitive environment anywhere. There is no way these folks, who fight like 
cats and dogs among themselves, would voluntarily transfer value to the 
pipeline group for the good of the bottom line." Lawner had to quickly back 
off the invitation - mentioning confidentiality restrictions - when it 
appeared about half the room was ready to troop over to the trading floor. 

thanks alot for the help.

Jeff

Jess,  what do know about this?  If you have any info let Jeff Nieland 
know.   

Jeff  N.,  I am not familiar with the Cal. EEP.  In most state it is not 
unusual for transmission customer (usually all the  customers are involved)  
to be part of the plans.  Jeff Dasovich or Roger Yang may have more details. 

Gentlemen,

Do we have any influence over this issue with our direct access customers in 
California?  IBM San Jose is on an interruptible transmission tariff and is 
concerned about the proposed Mandatory Curtailment Plan.  I would appreciate 
any comments.

Thanks

Jeff

Tom - Who would you recommend asking to comment from our regulatory 
department?

Kumar,

I have distributed the plan to our commodity and regulatory departments for 
comments.  After receiving their comments, I will summarize and forward.  
Please contact me with questions.

Thanks

Jeff

Jeff,
We are concerned about the impact of the proposed Mandatory Curtailment
Plan.\ (Please see Lynn's Note below)   Please review from a commodity
provider standpoint.  In your opinion, is it fair for us to be subject to
such legislation while we are a Direct Access Customer?

I would appreciate your comments.

This is the item regarding mandatory curtailment Karen Jarrell
referenced to in her note.

Hi Dan and Tom,

Greetings.  I hope all is well with both of you and PPG.

I recently received information that transmission voltage customers will
likely be required to be involved in the Electric Emergency Plan (EEP)
in the future.  Currently transmission customers are not "required" to
curtail any load when distribution circuits are taken off line as a
result of a Stage 3 EEP operation.

Please take a look at the attachment below and if possible provide
comments to help shape the proposed change.  I will need comments by
this Friday noon if possible.  Thanks for the input.

Thanks, Scott. 

Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev:  Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort 
underway in San Diego.  Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial 
contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., 
He'd like Erki to be the contact person.  Erik could you copy your vitals 
(title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they 
can forward along to Alpert?

Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could 
make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if 
needed):

The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from 
Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made 
the customer better off.
Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and 
should have going forward.
Any "solution" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the 
continuation of Direct Access for all customers.
As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that 
Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy.
Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase 
costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

just got word that my prof's sick, so i don't have class tonite.

Marty:  Thanks for the information.

Getting Eric's contact information to Alpert's office is in motion.  
Regarding attempt to follow-up with those who called Alpert's office to 
complain, I wasn't clear on that action.  Likely makes sense for Eric to 
coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office.  
Letters are an attempt to influence Alpert to 1) fix the Direct Access 
prohibition and 2) ensure that DA customers don't get saddled with the DWR 
costs.

Let me know if this approach works.

Jeff

ensure that there was an Enron contact if another complaint came in.
find out from Alpert's office if we could call back a few of those who called 
to complain to find out what they perceived, correct the misperception, 
apologize.  

Thanks, Scott.

Consider the facts:

- 80% of the materials in this vehicle's construction are recyclable.
- Although it weighs 7,200 lbs, it gets 14 mpg, city, 18 mpg, highway, better 
than most 6-cylinder SUV's.
- It's the only SUV that has a "blocker beam," a sort of low-slung bumper 
behind the front bumper designed to transfer the energy of an impact with a 
small car directly onto the small car's rear bumper, mitigating the risk of 
the Excursion riding up and over the smaller car.  In addition, the standard 
class V hitch is set low on the rear frame and, similar to the blocker beam 
up front, is designed to absorb the energy of a rear crash.
- It is a high efficiency, smokeless turbo-charged diesel engine... although 
diesels produce more particulates than gasoline engines, overall, they don't 
produce nearly the pollution of a gas-fired engine.  See below:

Diesel engine 
In general terms the diesel engine is less polluting that the petrol engine, 
it produces 25 times less carbon monoxide, 15 times less hydrocarbons without 
burning and half as much nitrogen oxide, whereas the emissions of sulphur 
dioxide are higher. 

Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that when the load of the diesel 
engine approaches the maximum, the formation of soot increases radically 
(which may even go so far as to multiply the concentration of black lead by 
20). 

This phenomenon does not occur with petrol vehicles, in which the 
concentration of particles in the exhaust gases is kept practically constant. 
In order to prevent this, we can recycle part of the exhaust gases through 
the air inlet and place filters in the exhaust in order to reduce the 
emission of particles.

from a petrol engine and a diesel engine

Attached is a fairly distilled summary of the projects Enron's offered to the 
utilities, DWR and the ISO over the past 9-12 months, or so.  With respect to 
the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and 
Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only 
offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get 
more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks 
would like that information.  Just let me know. Prices are included for the 
offers that had prices attached when submitted.

Attached in Word format are the draft IEP comments, due to be filed on the 
22nd, regarding the FERC Staff Report on market monitoring and market power 
mitigation.  This is my suggested approach, which is obviously subject to 
change per our discussion during the call tomorrow.

I would like to highlight that the draft characterizes the approach as a 
"circuit breaker" during periods of highest demand and suggests that this is 
distinct from notions of market power abuse.  Other entities are arguing that 
during the highest demand, when it exceeds available supplies, all suppliers 
have and are "exercising" (as distinct from abusing?) market power.  The 
draft attempts to highlight the current regional supply context characterized 
by the drought as a rationale for the "emergency circuit breaker."

As mentioned in Katie Kaplan's email this morning, if your company has a 
draft of comments, we would appreciate an opportunity to look at them to 
avoid substantive conflicts.

I trust this is the right distribution list but I was not able to use the 
list from this morning's email because of computer problems at my end.  ABB

Title: California in the Dark
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2302

In a recent Washington Post op-ed piece, Dan Yergin and Larry Makovich 
discuss the continued mess of California's electric power problems. Rather 
than fixing the flaws, the current policies from Sacramento are moving 
California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices 
for consumers and businesses. And the shortage is going to get worse this 
summer.

CERA Knowledge Area(s): Global Energy,

FYI.  Any thoughts Joe & Co.? Is release from contracts an "increase supply" 
option?  My fear is that QFs get released and then California's "police 
state" mentality kicks in, enacting Exec Orders, legislation, etc. to ensure 
that the power from the QF facilities stays in California.

Best,
Jeff

We are trying to set up energy purchasing arrangements with QFs who get 
temporarily released from their contracts.  Take a look at the e-mail below 
and see if we can suport them.

Thanks

Gentlemen,

In light of the possible backouts in California today and later this week,
if it is possible, Ridgewood Power requests that your organization intervene
in support of the attached emergency filing at the FERC.  Please send this
e-mail to your firm's general counsel and ask him to contact either our
Washington counsel, Carol Smoots (202-496-7196), our general counsel, Dan
Gulino (800-331-8006, x-118) or me at (800-331-8006, x-163).  Any help would
be most appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Bill Short

But for the very minor edits attached, the letter looks fine with me.

Best,
Jeff

We're a client, so I'm assuming internally we have access codes for folks to 
use.  I'm trying to get one.  Worry not; I'll track it down.  Thanks very 
much for the info.

Best,
Jeff

Hi and good morning.  Could you please book me a ticket for Portland.  Need 
to arrive in Portland on this coming Monday morning by 8-8:30 AM, and return 
to SF at around 4:30-5:00 PM on Tuesday.  Thanks very much.  Also, could you 
book me a hotel room at the 5th Avenue place (or whatever it's called).  
Muchos gracias.

FYI.  In case folks hadn't heard.

"Likewise, the state is paying $25,000 through June to a Washington, D.C., 
firm headed by former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston. He served as chairman of the 
Senate's energy committee and will advise California on dealing with federal 
energy regulators. "

Best,
Jeff

I'm here.  If you'd like to de-brief on my marathon with Kasler, just give a 
holler.

Best,
Jeff

Seems to me that that's exactly what the letter is saying and represents the 
commitment that we've made to our customers since raising the issue of 
re-sourcing, i.e., they'll pay the cost embedded in the contract, period. No 
more and less. I've assumed that the exposure associated with the 
utility-sourced electricity is substantially lower than the exposure 
associated with the customers remaining DA customers.  Can you verify Mike 
Smith?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Within the context of the current situation it makes sense.  But are you
really intending that Enron will pay the difference between the bundled rate
and the cost of power purchased by DWR when Sutter gets a bill for that from
PG&E?  If you are this makes sense.  If not, we should not send it and need
to discuss it further.  Mike Day

Jeff and Mike--attached is a letter we propose to send to our customer
Sutter Health as a "we're here for you" type gesture.  There has been some
UCCSU-type noise from this customr and we want to try to head it off.  Could
you please review and comment on my language regarding the rate surcharges
and make sure I've got the point right? What I want to make clear is that
these rate surcharges have no bearing on our K (we're covering them) and
that our decision to D-DASR these accounts has no bearing on the effect of
such surcharges on the completion of our K.  Please let me know if this
makes sense.  We are trying to get this out in the am, so if you can comment
tonite or first thing tomorrow that would be great.  Just respond to my work
e-mail at msmith1@enron.com.  Thanks.  Mike Smith

That explains why he spoke at the WGA meeting in Portland and supported price 
caps.  He's also apparently working for Bryson at Edison.  

Thanks very much.  It needs to go to Bev.  I don't have her email address, 
though.  Can you send it to her?  Also copy Scott, Hedy and Sandi.

Thanks.

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will "play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis." 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	"With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch," the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to "ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher," the letter said. "This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years." 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	"We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead," the letter said. 
"With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation."

On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking 
that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to bring 
more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that 
customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive 
imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.
 
The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be 
interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the 
Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in 
their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of 
those customers.
 
Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.

I talked with Hedy (sp?) Govenar this afternoon.  Two developments:  1.)  
"Noise" from Ms. Alpert's office has stopped.  We believe initial reports 
from Staff may have been overstated.  2.)  Decisions on Enron's proposed 
amendments are due today.  Timing wouldn't not be right for a discussion with 
me.

Action:  Hedy is aware of the situation and has asked Staff to tell her of 
any more occurrences.  Hedy has my number and will be in touch with any 
reports, at which time we will take action.  For now, we will let the "dog" 
sleep and lie.

Jeff and Eric,
I have NO problem trying to get letters for support of Direct Access.  Eric, 
if we can get those to support Jeff and Sandi, this is wonderful.  

Also, I had asked Eric to check with Alpert's office to register our follow 
on phone number and offer to try to correct the aggravated customers.  Eric, 
if you can provide a status on all of these as you make progress, that's 
appreciated.
Marty:  Thanks for the information.

Getting Eric's contact information to Alpert's office is in motion.  
Regarding attempt to follow-up with those who called Alpert's office to 
complain, I wasn't clear on that action.  Likely makes sense for Eric to 
coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office.  
Letters are an attempt to influence Alpert to 1) fix the Direct Access 
prohibition and 2) ensure that DA customers don't get saddled with the DWR 
costs.

Let me know if this approach works.

Best,
Jeff

All I asked Eric to do was:
ensure that there was an Enron contact if another complaint came in.
find out from Alpert's office if we could call back a few of those who called 
to complain to find out what they perceived, correct the misperception, 
apologize.  

Thanks, Scott. 

Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev:  Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort 
underway in San Diego.  Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial 
contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., 
He'd like Erki to be the contact person.  Erik could you copy your vitals 
(title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they 
can forward along to Alpert?

Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could 
make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if 
needed):

The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from 
Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made 
the customer better off.
Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and 
should have going forward.
Any "solution" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the 
continuation of Direct Access for all customers.
As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that 
Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy.
Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase 
costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

I talked with Hedy (sp?) Govenar this afternoon.  Two developments:  1.)  
"Noise" from Ms. Alpert's office has stopped.  We believe initial reports 
from Staff may have been overstated.  2.)  Decisions on Enron's proposed 
amendments are due today.  Timing wouldn't not be right for a discussion with 
me.

Action:  Hedy is aware of the situation and has asked Staff to tell her of 
any more occurrences.  Hedy has my number and will be in touch with any

p.s.  Purchase of the Excursion is defensible (barely), SoCal's "windowing"

Consider the facts:

- 80% of the materials in this vehicle's construction are recyclable.
- Although it weighs 7,200 lbs, it gets 14 mpg, city, 18 mpg, highway, better 
than most 6-cylinder SUV's.
- It's the only SUV that has a "blocker beam," a sort of low-slung bumper 
behind the front bumper designed to transfer the energy of an impact with a 
small car directly onto the small car's rear bumper, mitigating the risk of 
the Excursion riding up and over the smaller car.  In addition, the standard 
class V hitch is set low on the rear frame and, similar to the blocker beam 
up front, is designed to absorb the energy of a rear crash.
- It is a high efficiency, smokeless turbo-charged diesel engine... although 
diesels produce more particulates than gasoline engines, overall, they don't 
produce nearly the pollution of a gas-fired engine.  See below:

Diesel engine 
In general terms the diesel engine is less polluting that the petrol engine, 
it produces 25 times less carbon monoxide, 15 times less hydrocarbons without 
burning and half as much nitrogen oxide, whereas the emissions of sulphur 
dioxide are higher. 

Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that when the load of the diesel 
engine approaches the maximum, the formation of soot increases radically 
(which may even go so far as to multiply the concentration of black lead by 
20). 

This phenomenon does not occur with petrol vehicles, in which the 
concentration of particles in the exhaust gases is kept practically constant. 
In order to prevent this, we can recycle part of the exhaust gases through 
the air inlet and place filters in the exhaust in order to reduce the 
emission of particles.

from a petrol engine and a diesel engine

Dude,
Not seeing (either of) the comments directly, its hard to say what our 
position should be -- Mr. Dasovich, I'll leave that up to your good 
judgment.  However, it would appear that TURN is looking to roll back the 
clock on any progress we might have made in the GIR process to separate 
utility services and make them independently available to the marketplace.  
On that basis, I'd say you've got a reasonable argument to make.  

As far as Transwestern is concerned, I'd say that, as a general matter, we 
oppose any change in regulations that would attempt to repackage or rebundle 
utility services that gives the effect of reducing customer choice.  On the 
other hand, given the backdrop of a frustrated effort in the GIR proceeding, 
as long as they're leaving Hector Road alone, its hard for me to get too 
fired up about anything in California these days.  

Let us know if there is anything you'd like us to do here.  Ours is but to 
serve, my liege.

Jeff

Greetings Mr. Newlywed and Ms Bride-to-be!  (Shewt, I'm gettin' all choked 
up.)

I think I'll need to protest TURN's proposal.  You folks aware of this?  Care?

Best,
Jeff
On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking 
that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to bring 
more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that 
customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive 
imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.
 
The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be 
interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the 
Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in 
their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of 
those customers.
 
Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.
 
Dan

Will do.  Thanks very much to you both.

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will "play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis." 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	"With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch," the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to "ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher," the letter said. "This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years." 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	"We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead," the letter said. 
"With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation."

I  agree. We should see the forest and not all the trees.
?
Bottom-line SBX 9 is a big step forward? in deploying clean  distributed 
generation. 
?
There  are always specific elements/details, which?might have been done  
differently, but I do believe most of us agree that this is a very positive 
step  for California and it will significantly help the State in the very 
challenging  energy situation it is facing.
?
Ake
It  would make since for people to read all of the language and to think in 
a  constructive manor.? If anyone is concerned with what can or can not be  
done they should feel free to call me.? Thus far every serious member of  the 
real estate community that I have spoken with or heard from is very  pleased 
with this progress.
Steven:
Not a single building owner I have talked to  beleives that you can install a 
meanigful amount of DG by July 1st.?  The bill is meaningless to BOMA with 
that amendment.? What plans are we  making to take that limitation out of the 
bill or to push it back?? If  not, the I don't think BOMA will support the 
bill any more.
Les
?
The Distributed  Energy Resources industry won a major battle yesterday.? 
The  California Senate Energy and Utilities Committee passed on a 7-0  
bipartisan vote, Sen. Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this  bill,?it 
was as much Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff  that discriminates 
against DER.? SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus  DER bill SBX 35 which is 
still alive and contains many important  provisions fro removing additional 
barriers.? Yesterday's vote  represents a major win because even if the bill 
ultimately does not get  enacted, a very important statement has been made by 
the committee.?  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their  proceedings.
?
The DER community  owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the 
Utilities Committee  Members and their staffs:
Sen. Bowen  (Chair)
Sen.  Alarcon
Sen.  Battin
Sen.  Dunn
Sen.  Murray
Sen.  Poochigian
Sen.  Sher
Sen.  Speier
Sen.  Vasconcellos
Sen.  Vincent
?
Also much thanks to  everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on 
this effort.?  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, 
government,  manufacturing, and real estate communities.
?
Here are the  highlights of yesterday's actions:
?

For IOU's- No  discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, 
2000 and  June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.? If you  
have a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until??July 1  2001, to get 
it installed.? 
DER installed within  the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011.  
The maximum capacity  of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site.  
The DER must have  emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB 
established new  guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early 
next  year.  
Customers with DER  are still required to pay interconnection, public purpose 
charges, and  obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources energy 
purchases  program.  
The CPUC shall  require the electrical corporations to include non-utility 
owned DER in  its planning process.  
The CPUC is required to  establish a firewall so that in the event that the 
implementation of DER  results in net costs to the system, those costs stay 
within the customer  class.  
The CPUC shall  require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that 
are  non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the  
costs.  
Muni's are required  to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold 
public meetings  to solicit comment for recommended changes.

Now we have momentum,  but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do 
on the Assembly side  and with Governor's office.? We need the continued 
(increased)  support of all of you as we move this forward.

Greetings:

The governor will be holding a press conference and availability at 4:00
today to supposedly discuss the QF and Blackouts issues.  There are no
written documents or available materials at this time.  We do understand
that it will be satellite unlinked so there is a chance some stations may
carry it live.  If you have access to the Internet or squawk box you can
listen into room 1190- no guarantee they will be airing the press
conference.

This is all based or rumor and research and the Governor's office has not
confirmed anything.

In the event there is a press conference IEP will be orchestrating a
response immediately.

We will keep you posted.

Attached is a ruling by ALJ DeUlloa issued yesterday pertaining to the
calculation of the California Procurement Adjustment.  A draft decision was
suppose to be release on such on Friday, March 16th.  It was not, and now we
know why.  On March 14th, the Department of Water Resources wrote to the
Commission to give the commission its views on how the CPA should be
calculated. In his ruling of yesterday DeUlloa stated that he would wait to
issue the PD so as to take into account DWR's submission. He also provided
parties until tomorrow to file comments on the DWR letter (which is attached
to the ruling).

Not surprising, DWR has a different view of the world than the UDCs do when
it comes to calculating the CPA.  The UDCs view the CPA as residual amount
left over from the generation component of their bundled rate on 1/5/01
after the cost of their retained generation (including QFs and bilateral
contracts) are subtracted out. DWR views the CPA as a rate (i.e., a cent per
kWh) which would be paid to DWR by the UDCs every month. It is DWR's view
that a Total Generation Related Rate must be calculated which is a blended
average of the cost of the UDC retained generation and the cost of the "net
short" power.  From this total rate (e.g.., 5 cent) the cost  of the UDC
retained generation (e.g., 2 cent) would be subtracted and the remainder
(i.e., 3 cent per kwh) would be the CPA.  This CPA would be subject to
further allocation by the Commission to determine the Fixed Department of
Water Resources Set-Aside. DWR is not asking that such allocation be done
now.

DWR's view of the world would place it in a sounder financial position,
making it a more viable purchaser of electricity for California, but would
place the UDCs in more dire straights.

Please let me know by tomorrow at noon if you want to comment on the DWR
proposal.

We're getting a lot of inquiries about Enron's role in California's de-reg 
history, with a lot of misinformation arising out of Peace's handywork.  

I spent about 3 hours on Friday with a Sac Bee reporter (Dale Kasler).  He'll 
be interviewing Skilling on the same topic in a week or so, and he'd like to 
talk to Steve, too.  

Sue spent time with a NYT reporter discussing the same. Some common themes 
are arising in the questions.  Thought it would be a good idea to spend 30 
minutes discussing those themes and developing our messages to ensure 
consistency.  If folks think it would be useful, is there a time this week 
that we could squeeze in 30 minutes?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

In compliance with the new Houston Clean Air standards Mr. Fawcett has agreed 
to use his new vehicle for carpooling (a generous gesture as we know he would 
much rather just ride the Metro bus to work).

FYI:  The City of Long Beach has now joined in the law suits.  They've sued 
SoCalGas and El Paso claiming (like the others who've sued) that the two 
conspired to "kill competition" and drive up prices.  I think that we can 
expect that topic to get some airtime, since the TURN's, Harvey's, UCAN's 
etc. of the world will likely be steering all the Democrats.  

I'll throw some questions together; but won't be till the end of the day.

Utilities' Demand Blocks Bailout 
NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell 
transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M
N114450.DTL 
California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates 
be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has 
learned. 
A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier 
industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from 
consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges 
that rates would remain unchanged. 
Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher 
rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell 
the state their transmission systems and some land. 
The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials 
realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public 
Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers. 
The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from 
runaway wholesale electricity prices. 
The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing 
complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances 
of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped 
utilities. 
The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of 
the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land, 
including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear 
power plant. 
Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's 
dysfunctional electricity market. 
"Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment," 
said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that 
is advising Davis in the talks. 
"The past situation has not worked well," he added. "The utilities want some 
certainty about their future." 
TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON
To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the 
state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion. Discussions 
with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks. 
An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday 
that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale. 
"Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall," the official 
said. "One of the dominoes is the rate freeze." 
A PG&E spokesman declined to comment. 
In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the 
rate freeze for months. 
The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the 
PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion 
in debt accrued as a result of the freeze. 
"They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in 
various forms," said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC. "Adding it to the 
present talks is consistent with past behavior." 
Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be 
making progress. 
Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, 
told clients on Monday that the discussions "may have lost some momentum in 
recent days." He did not give a reason. 
For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the 
talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent. 
SECRET STICKING POINTS
"We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded, 
and we will work out an agreement," Davis said at an appearance in San Jose. 
"But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm 
not going to reveal." 
One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of 
utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze. 
Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms 
into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the 
additions was not realized by state officials until this week. 
One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the 
radar screen of state negotiators. But the upshot, once the words had been 
parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates. 
CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE
In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking 
the PUC "to support the creditworthiness" of the utility. 
"This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and 
utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital, 
consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions," 
it says. 
Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state 
that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from 
ratepayers. 
"There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends 
if it is adopted," the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to 
disagree with such assumptions. 
But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in 
stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch. 
"This is a very complex transaction," he said. "God and the devil are in the 
details."

PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts

N33580.DTL 
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other 
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a 
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. 
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward 
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. 
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which 
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who 
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities 
that buy their power return to solvency. 
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for 
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or 
"QFs" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. 
"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the 
money designed to compensate the QFs," Davis said. "It's immoral and has to 
stop." 
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil 
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's 
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not 
paid them since November. 
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers 
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, 
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power 
grid. 
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday 
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. 
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more 
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor 
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings 
from other creditors. 
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. 
"It is critical to keep these facilities up and online," said Sen. Debra 
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash 
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. "The utilities owe it to the people of the 
state to pay them." 
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative 
producers ahead of their other creditors. 
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes 
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the 
governor's office about possible payment structures. 
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural 
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash 
they must close their plants. 
"We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten 
the health of everyone else," said V. John White, legislative director of the 
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. 
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the 
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility 
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with 
Edison which has paid them nothing since November. 
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes 
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. 
"We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in 
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest 
employer in the county," said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. 
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. 
"We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet 
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs 
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen 
rates," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. 
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators 
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for 
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations 
eventually failed to move forward.

California governor blames utilities for blackouts

By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (March 21, 2001 8:10 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - 
Gov. Gray Davis said the state's two largest utilities are partly to blame 
for this week's widespread blackouts because they failed to pay millions of 
dollars owed to environmentally friendly power generators. 
Davis said the utilities took money from customers while failing to pay the 
alternative plants, which use renewable forms of energy like steam and 
natural gas to generate electricity. 
The state has been spending about $45 million a day since January to buy 
power for customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which are so credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them. 
"It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not 
pay the generators," the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday. 
"They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop." 
The state lost about 3,100 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 3.1 
million homes, on Tuesday from alternative energy plants that say they can't 
afford to keep operating because the utilities haven't paid their bills in 
weeks. 
Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the 
utilities to pre-pay future bills to the alternative plants. 
PG&E called Gray's statements "inappropriate and unjustified," adding that it 
was negotiating a payment plan with the suppliers. Edison said it is intent 
on paying creditors and working with the Public Utilities Commission to pay 
the plants for future power sales. 
Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to 
climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation 
law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers. 
Keepers of the state's power grid were cautiously optimistic that California 
might get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts after 
two idle plants were returned to service. 
"Never say never - but it appears we are going to be in better shape tomorrow 
(Wednesday) and for the rest of the week," said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman 
for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the 
state's power grid. 
About a half-million customers were hit by Tuesday's blackouts, which snarled 
traffic and plunged schools and businesses into darkness from San Diego to 
the Oregon border. 
On Tuesday, Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell called on PUC President 
Loretty Lunch to resign. Lynch was appointed by Davis. 
Lynch couldn't be reached for comment, but a spokesman for the governor 
dismissed Campbell's complaints. 
Meanwhile, a leading lawmaker on energy issues said the PUC may soon have to 
raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities' 
bills. 
"My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able 
to plan for it," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley. "They don't have to like it, 
but I think they'll appreciate it." 
Davis has said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their 
bills without further rate increases. 
In the meantime, the ISO is counting on conservation to avoid more rolling 
blackouts. Dorinson estimated that conservation accounted for about 900 
megawatts in savings during Tuesday's peak usage. 
"That probably was the difference today in helping us avoid any rolling 
blackouts late into the evening," Dorinson said. 
Tuesday's outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until 
about 2 p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order. They were blamed for at 
least one serious traffic accident. 
The blackouts were caused by a combination of problems, including 
unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the Pacific 
Northwest, numerous power plants being shut down for repairs and the loss of 
power from alternative generators. 

Mike:  Here are my comments.  Apologies for the fact that they are quick and 
dirty.

All Enron's public statements that I have read, including, I think, 
statements made to financial analysts, state that our exposure in California 
is not "material."  Dennis' declaration says that the situation in California 
has been a "financial disaster," that "Enron has lost over $300 million," and 
that "Enron stands to lose millions more."  The losses are described as 
"huge."  Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the 
market, but I'm not aware of it.  And if it hasn't, it could represent a 
significant conflict with previous statements.  Seems prudent to run this by 
IR and perhaps others before releasing.
Regarding the statements about our hedging strategy.  It would seem prudent 
to run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to 
making public.
Very minor technical point--I don't think that AB 1890 was passed 
"unanimously."  I think that there was 1 nay vote.
The statement is made that "the utilities were required to sell off most of 
their generating capacity."  The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2 
of their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to 
about .2-.25 of their total gen assets).  They chose voluntarily to sell of 
the remainder of their fossil-fired plants.
It is stated that stranded costs are "investments in imprudent power 
generation facilities."  These investments were in fact found in the past to 
be prudent by the PUC.  Would therefore not seem accurate to call them 
imprudent now.
Is it now "virtually impossible to manage commodity risk" in California?  
Just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation 
somewhat.
From a PR perspective, I'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing 
UC/CSU in the following manner, "It was actually a relatively easy decision 
to make."  Makes Enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed.

Best,
Jeff

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will "play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis." 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	"With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch," the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to "ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher," the letter said. "This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years." 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	"We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead," the letter said. 
"With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation."

Jeanne,

I think you are saying more and going into more detail than we need to.  It 
was my understanding from the call that you were not going to get into the 
statutory interpretation issues at all.  

I think modifying the first sentence of the carryover to the top of page 2 
(at least as printed on my machine) is fully sufficient if you just say:

"Moreover, EPMI submits that DWR has presented the Commission with a 
reasonable [STRIKEOUT interpretation of the STRIKEOUT]  approach for 
implementing the applicable statutory language."  

I do not understand the benefit of the balance of the paragraph.  It opens us 
up to getting drug into a interpretation argument we do not need to be in.

Similarly, I do not understand why we would want to say "is consistent with 
the statutory language" and similar statements in the following paragraph.

I am not sure I agree fully with those statements or that we need to be 
limiting our ability to respond to any further proposals which may come out 
by taking a firm position of the statutory foundation for CDWR's approach in 
this letter.

Am I missing something?   Thanks

I spoke with ABAG attorney Kenneth Moy and APS attorney Dan Douglas.
Neither was thrilled with the Wood/Barnett draw, but neither was immediately
warm to the notion of a negotiated continuance.  I outlined the arguments
against charging into the guns of Wood and Barnett, and reminded them that
there could very likely be delays anyway as a result of the CPUC's continued
indecision about the end of the rate freeze--which looks to be increasing as
a result of the Administration's deadlock with the utilities.  They both
indicated that they would discuss the matter with their clients and get back
to us shortly.  I suspect at least one of them will say "no we want to go

Tom:  Apologies.  I'm wrapped up, but will try to come up with more.  Three 
things that come to mind:

1. Seems important that any price cap include a hard sunset date.
2. Direct Access for all customers in California should be a concession.
3. Dramatic commitment from California to substantially upgrade the in-state 
gas transportation network (fyi: it may  be in worse shape than the electric 
tx network--can build more plants, but if one can't get the gas to them.....)

Agreed.  I think that we can expect a strategy focused on saying, "we don't 
owe you anything, you've illegally hiked prices."

This paraphrased from Tom Briggs, Enron Govt Affairs, DC:

The Bush Administration has indicated that it will not support any sort of 
legislation containing price caps.  Although something could get out of the 
Senate, it won't go anywhere without Administration support.

Thus, by default, the just and reasonable standard becomes the FERC's 
evolving rate-screen process, which, for imports into California, is  "daily 
spot market gas prices and an average 12,000 Btu/kWh heat rate."  The 
standard for in-state resoruces is higher, more like 18,000 Btu/KwH.

Instead, expect to see legislation that will take short-term actions to 
increase supply and decrease demand.  This could include demand buy down 
programs, and laws the force utility financial solvency.

Every day is a new day but I am told this will likely be the status quo until 
the congressional recess is over (recess is from 6-30 April).

Steve/Lisa:

Environmental issues and the permitting will be the biggest (and could be 
very big) obstacles---particularly given the Santa Barbara location (e.g., 
Channel Islands, etc.).  Might be a good idea to have GA look into that side 
of things.  If we feel that can be overcome, then the next big deal will be 
getting transportation agreements with SoCalGas.  Finally, the issue you 
raised Steve---will Davis want to be the counterparty?---will loom somewhat 
large.  Overall sounds like an exciting idea/opportunity.

Court Gives Green Light to Green Generator To Suspend Edison Contract, Sell 
Electricity Elsewhere

Business Wire
03/22/01, 4:43p
(Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)

EL CENTRO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2001--A California court ruled 
today that a geothermal energy supplier in the Imperial Valley can 
temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term 
contracts with Southern California Edison, because Edison has breached the 
contract by failing to pay for any output since Nov. 1.

Cal Energy Operating Corp. operates a complex of geothermal plants near the 
Salton Sea. The plants filed suit Feb. 20 in Imperial County Superior Court 
seeking back payment from Edison and authorization to suspend their contracts 
with Edison and sell power elsewhere in California during such time Edison is 
unable to pay for power demand.

David L. Sokol, chairman of Cal Energy, said, "We applaud this short-term 
solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean, 
renewable power flowing to Californians. It is unfortunate that it took court 
action to provide us some relief from an intolerable situation."

Sokol noted that the ruling did nothing to assure that the plants collect 
approximately $140 million Edison owes them for power they have produced 
since Nov 1. The geothermal plants will continue to pursue legal and 
legislative remedies to receive back payment, he said. "That debt will 
continue to place a great strain on our operation."

He added that Edison has continued to collect tens of millions daily from 
ratepayers and has amassed approximately $2 billion in cash.

On the open market, the geothermal plants will be able to receive on the spot 
market higher prices than renewable generators agreed to accept in 
negotiations with the state, Edison and PG&E. That lower price had been 
incorporated in Senate Bill 47X, which stalled in the state legislature after 
Edison withdrew its support, and has effectively been incorporated in the 
California Public Utility Commission's proposed order. California taxpayers 
will pay the difference, because the state is buying electricity on the open 
market on behalf of Edison and PG&E.

"It is unfortunate that taxpayers will now be paying more for our 
electricity," Sokol said. "That is the result of inaction by the state and 
bad faith by Edison. We negotiated with the full blessing and knowledge of 
the governor and the legislature to arrive at long-term pricing that would 
assure reliable supply and save taxpayers billions. This pricing for our 
clean, renewable energy was less than the state is paying out-of-state 
fossil-fuel energy providers in long-term contracts, and less than half what 
we are allowed under federal law."

Sokol added that he was encouraged by the governor's March 20 announcement 
proposing legislation and action by the California Public Utility Commission 
that would require Edison and PG&E to begin paying current bills for 
electricity received from qualifying facilities such as CalEnergy.

But, Sokol cautioned, "While we are hopeful that this legislative and 
regulatory action can move forward quickly, there are many details to be 
worked out in the governor's proposal. Even with quick action, there is a 
serious question whether Edison is willing to pay any of its current bills 
from qualifying facilities."

He noted that, like today's court ruling, the governor's proposal provides no 
plan or schedule to require Edison to pay the approximately $140 million 
Edison owes for power CalEnergy has delivered to date.

CalEnergy's geothermal complex employs about 200 workers and produces a total 
of 268 megawatts -- enough to supply 268,000 homes.

Geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about 
12 percent of California's electricity, enough for 5 million homes. 
Geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells 
that tap superheated water 5,000 to 10,000 feet underground. Magma rising in 
fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 500-700 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The generating plants convert the water to "live" steam, the pressure of 
which turns turbines to produce electricity. The plants then return the 
slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a 
renewable resource.

CalEnergy is one of 10 members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, a 
group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on Feb. 15 to explore 
options to collect back payments from Edison. Together, the group is owed 
more than $300 million by Edison.

Note to Editors: David Sokol will discuss today's ruling in a media 
teleconference at 2:30 p.m. PST today, March 22. Call 800/810-0924 and enter 
code 509085. Identify the CalEnergy conference.

Yes, it's technically true, but it doesn't seem relevant.  It's a 
technicality.  That is, if at the end of the contract, UC/CSU goes to another 
provider, the rules would require Enron to "de-DASR," after which the new 
provider would submit the new DASR to switch the customer over.  The utility 
stands in the middle of all this.  I don't think this equates to what UC/CSU 
is claiming the problem is.  Might be viewed as a bit "cute" by the judge.

Also, the legislation "fixing" the prohibition passed our of policy committee 
today in Sacramento and is moving through the Legislature.

Best,
Jeff

Please review and let me know if you have any comments, esp. para. 12.  This 
was Mike Smith's suggestion.

 - 0347511.02

This is yet another, tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help; 
they can and will only make matters worse.  Caps are a policy chainsaw when a 
scalpel is needed.  The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and 
the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply 
and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be 
doing.

FYI:  I listened in to Sokol's conference call yesterday re: court case 
freeing CalEnergy from the QF contract.  Sokol blasted Edison over and over 
(e.g., accumulated war chest of over $2 billion in cash).  Sokol said that, 
at least for the time being, this lessens the need for CalEnergy specifically 
to force an involuntary.  Be interesting to see if other QFs take similar 
tack.  Sokol also said that CalEnergy has sold the power to El Paso---lot's 
of press questions about price and where the power's headed (i.e., in our out 
of state).   He said he expects to get a "market price" from El Paso and that 
if the "prices are higher out of state, well......."

Jeff

? The legislature will meet and vote to repeal Section 390 of AB 1890.  This 
will reverse what the QFs get  paid from natural gas costs and replace it 
with the formula in the governor's current plan - 7.9 cents/kwh for 5-year 
contracts and 6.9 cents/kwh for 10-year  contracts.  According to sources, 
this is "locked in to pass."  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on 
Monday.
 
? The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they 
would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to 
operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired 
QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to 
either operate unprofitably or shut down.
 
? The QF community is responding with an increased militancy for an 
involuntary filing, according to sources.  The most aggressive QF after Coram 
Energy is David Sokol and Walter Scott of Mid-America Energy (based in 
Nebraska).  Sokol is described  by sources as "extremely aggressive." 
 
? An involuntary bankruptcy filing appears imminent.   Sources believes the 
trigger event will either be the legislative passage of the plan  tomorrow or 
the PUC order implementing the plan on Monday.

Executive Summary:

? The as yet unnumbered rescue bill by Davis made it to the Senate floor
? An exemption of the gas-fired QFs from this bill (as proposed by Sen. 
Keeley) could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing.
? If passed, the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another 15 days 
after rate hikes to pay the QFs
? The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed 
by the utilities to the DWR. Senators are demanding that the utilities set up 
a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR. 
? The CalEnergy ruling (as reported by Bloomberg this PM) is an attractive 
option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape long-term supply 
contracts with Edison.
? If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gas-fired generators 
from the new rate structure, an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is 
expected.  However, if the exemption is implemented, then a bankruptcy filing 
would be delayed.

1. "QF Bill" Makes it to Senate Floor

The "CPUC bill" (the number is not yet known) is in mock-up form and does the 
following:

* Repeals PUC Code section 390, which set a formula for QFs under 
deregulation.
* Amends portions of AB 1X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its 
power purchases, and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds.
* Includes a provision for SDG&E rates since they were not covered under 
other legislation.

The bill passed the Senate Energy (8-2), and also just passed the Senate 
Appropriations Committee (8-2) and is headed to the Senate Floor.  

2. Senator Comments on the Bill:

Keeley (author of bill) presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide 
the QF contracts which is the proper authority  to debate the issue.

Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact 
that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for 
natural gas-fired QFs.  Republicans offered an amendment to not have section 
390 repealed for gas-fired generators, but Keeley had concerns with the 
amendment.  Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUC's 
flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad.  He also 
indicated that gas-fired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft 
order.  He said that the PUC order needs to be amended, and Keeley is 
confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past 48 
hours.

3. Opponents to the QF Bill:

The following people testified in opposition to QF portion:  TURN, Delta 
Power (QF), Syke Energy, John Hancock Financial, California Manufacturers 
Association, Crockett Cogeneration, Independent Energy Producers, Clean Power 
Campaign, PG&E, SCE.

The gas-fired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been 
off-line for a couple of months and cannot come back on-line unless their 
issues are addressed.

In response to the QFs not getting paid, Sen. Bowen stated that if the 
utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order, then she 
would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy.

4. PG&E and SCE Testimony:

Sen. Battin asked both utilities about the draft order, which states that 
after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within 15 
days, and whether the utilities would abide by the order.

PG&E's response was that they are receiving $400 million per month, the cost 
of their own generation is $100 million, and the QF amount is $240 million 
per month; the draft order would lower the QF cost to $140 million.   PG&E 
was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to 
Battin's question was "yes or no."  Battin, Bowen and Murray all asked
whether it was yes or no.  The PG&E rep stated that it would be "no" if the 
issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved.  If the ISO costs 
of purchases were included in the DWR payments, then PG&E would not have a 
problem.

The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money 
going out, then it could not comply with the PUC order.

5.  Payments to DWR

Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB 1X 
that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for 
purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those.  
SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and 
conditions.  Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of 
the bill, and that they should have a trust fund set up.  PG&E noted that 
they are setting 'some' money aside, but would not state how much. Sen. Sher 
ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust 
fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or 'go after 
them' for violating the law.

1X Provisions:

Tim Gage from Dept. of Finance noted the Governor's support of the entire 
bill, and noted that the 1X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid.

PG&E also testified in opposition to these provisions.

Senator Bowen made the following statements:

* Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of $500 
million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the 
funding unless PG&E and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR 
issue.
* Also stated that the PUC could always raise rates as a way to resolve the 
issue.

This paraphrased from Tom Briggs, Enron Govt Affairs, DC:

The Bush Administration has indicated that it will not support any sort of 
legislation containing price caps.  Although something could get out of the 
Senate, it won't go anywhere without Administration support.

Thus, by default, the just and reasonable standard becomes the FERC's 
evolving rate-screen process, which, for imports into California, is  "daily 
spot market gas prices and an average 12,000 Btu/kWh heat rate."  The 
standard for in-state resoruces is higher, more like 18,000 Btu/KwH.

Instead, expect to see legislation that will take short-term actions to 
increase supply and decrease demand.  This could include demand buy down 
programs, and laws the force utility financial solvency.

Every day is a new day but I am told this will likely be the status quo until 
the congressional recess is over (recess is from 6-30 April).

I spoke yesterday with President Lynch's gas advisor and the PUC staffer who 
first got in touch with us regarding inquiries from our customer regarding 
whether we were returning customers to the LDCs.  
I described our activities generally, and explained that the originial 
inquiry from our customer stemmed from a mix-up (on our part) that has since 
been cleared up.  
Both seemed satisfied, appreciated the call and the information and will get 
back to me regarding whether we'll need to submit a formal response to 
President Lynch's letter. (I said that our preference was not to respond 
formally, but would be happy to do so.)
I asked them to contact me directly should they receive any other inquiries 
from our customers.
Thanks to all for the help in responding.
Please keep me in the loop on our marketing activities, etc. 
If I hear anything about customers calling the PUC, I'll let you know, and 
I'll let you know what I hear back from Lynch's office regarding whether we 
need to respond formally.

Best,
Jeff

John:  Please keep this confidential, but as you can see, this is not at all 
what I'm looking for.  I need what we discussed yesterday.

Thanks,
Jeff

HEADLINE: State not a major power glutton 
CHARGES FALL FLAT: Statistics show California to be cautious user of energy 
supplies 

BYLINE: Andrew Bridges; The Associated Press 

BODY: 
LOS ANGELES -- California's continuing power crisis has led neighboring 
states to accuse the Golden State of hogging electricity, saying its appetite 
for energy threatens to plunge the entire West into darkness. 

But the numbers paint a different picture, one of a California that does use 
a vast amount of electricity but consumes less on a per-capita basis than all 
other states except Rhode Island. 

Mild weather and having proportionately fewer energy-gobbling industries than 
some other states are part of the reason. However, experts say credit also 
must go to stringent conservation guidelines. 

"It's true we're big, and it's true we didn't build a lot of power plants 
because of restructuring. But we're not energy hogs at all," said Arthur 
Rosenfeld, who sits on the five-member California Energy Commission. "We're 
almost as good as Western Europe, and Western Europe is about twice as energy 
efficient as the United States." 

Among the 50 states, only Texas consumes more energy -- its total use of 
electricity, natural gas and oil -- than California. 

However, California ranks 47th in per-capita energy use -- well below No. 4 
Texas, No. 20 Washington and No. 27 Oregon, according to statistics from the 
Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. 

When looking specifically at per-capita electricity consumption, California 
ranks 49th. The state's residents use 60 percent as much electricity as the 
average American. 

For air conditioning alone, a typical California household uses one-third the 
amount of electricity as a household in Texas or Florida, according to the 
U.S. Department of Energy's 1997 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. 

Experts say both weather and conservation measures play large roles in that 
figure. 

"It's a different climate, so even if you do have warm summers, they're not 
humid (in California), so you don't have the big, huge air conditioning load 
you see in Florida or Texas," said Robert Latta, the survey's manager at the 
Energy Information Administration. 

California also uses electricity, as well as natural gas, oil and coal, more 
wisely than most states thanks to aggressive conservation efforts started 
during the oil shocks of the early 1970s, federal and state data show. 

Key to those efforts are stringent standards for new homes and commercial 
buildings that dictate such guidelines as the types of windows and lighting 
that can be used to the amount of insulation. Roughly 60 percent of the 
electricity used in California goes to heat, cool and light those structures. 

"If (California) is not the leading state, they are at least tied for it" in 
efficiency standards, said Ed Wisniewski, deputy director of the Boston-based 
Consortium for Energy Efficiency. "Historically, they have been very 
progressive, and many of the programs we advocate nationally were started in 
California." 

The California Energy Commission, which shapes state energy policy and 
planning, estimates California's average demand for electricity at any given 
time at about 50,000 megawatts. That figure would be much greater if not for 
conservation efforts, Rosenfeld said. "If we used as much electricity as 
Texas, we'd be a 100,000-megawatt state," he said. 

Texas has more heavy industry, less stringent conservation mandates and a 
harsher climate. On the residential side, Texans use 50 percent more energy 
per household than Californians, much of that for heating and cooling.

At risk of sounding like a pain in the arse, we do need to get that damn 
boat out of here for this weekend's festivities. It's fine to have a Zodiac 
in the living room, if you live in a place like Medecino, but in a city as 
sophisticated as SF, it really does look declasse.

As we discussed on our public affairs committee conference call earlier this

Hi and good morning.  Could you please book me a ticket for Portland.  Need 
to arrive in Portland on this coming Monday morning by 8-8:30 AM, and return 
to SF at around 4:30-5:00 PM on Tuesday.  Thanks very much.  Also, could you 
book me a hotel room at the 5th Avenue place (or whatever it's called).  
Muchos gracias.

I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the 
following week to discuss. 

Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know 
that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today. The legislature is, however, 
holding hearings, taking a "comprehensive view" of the industry (i.e., 
focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity "price gouging").  They 
held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities 
underway in the Legislature.  I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing 
short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told 
stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship.  

One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe) 
waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and 
December.  I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting 
the PUC to appear that it's doing something.  I'll report more on the 
Legislative hearings as they occur.

Jeff

Also, Susan or I or both will be there.  I think it'd be a good idea to rally 
the 'ole "GIR" team by telephone to get our facts straight and understand the

Please see the following important stories.  It appears to be quickly 
slipping through Davis' fingers.  May be useful to re-group a bit in light of 
the following events.  In sum:

Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met 
with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom.  
DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by 
100%.  (See attached story.)
Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because 
Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, "don't move 8X (a bill that 
Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work; 
they need much more." 
It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis 
likes it or not.
The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had 
been informed of the "bombshell." 
Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the 
situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento.  (See attached story.)
Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they 
won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to 
implement on Tuesday).  (See attached PG&E press release.)
Finally, Mike Kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterday's Chronicle, in 
which he attempts to lump together into one pile Republicans, market

Bombshell Warning on Power Cost 
Spending may double and rates skyrocket, governor's office tells Legislature

N176940.DTL 
Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state 
may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the 
next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent. 
The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated 
promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without 
a rate increase. 
California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity 
buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to 
keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back 
on their feet. 
Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would 
have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion. 
But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm. 
"There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the 
negotiations, this can be added up any way you want," said Steve Maviglio, 
press secretary to Davis. 
"Those numbers are not based on any reality right now," he said. "There are 
too many things up in the air." 
Assembly Democrats told a different story. 
They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet 
Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with 
Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell. 
And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow 
lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration. 
They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the 
day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the 
figures. 
PURCHASES IN BILLIONS
The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the 
state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An 
additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year, 
they said. 
The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17 
because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases. 
From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power 
purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the 
amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills. 
Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10 
billion without raising rates. 
But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty 
rate increase would be necessary. 
INCREASE UPON INCREASE
The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a 
temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled 
for no later than March 2002. 
But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent 
increase would be required to cover the debt service. 
"For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is 
admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been 
shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the 
reality as soon as possible," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek 
(Santa Cruz County). 
One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them 
out. 
And it could mean political trouble for Davis. 
"Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's 
bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002," 
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
PG&E THREATENS SUIT
The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to 
court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors. 
Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power 
generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot 
afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as 
rolling blackouts spread across the state. 
The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers 
will resume debate Monday. 
Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment 
to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has 
spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first. 
Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing 
plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern 
California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators 
provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes. 
PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the 
state for the billions it has spent purchasing power. 
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," Gordon Smith, PG&E's 
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS
According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in 
rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds 
$1. 4 billion a month. 
But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their 
own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible. 
"It's just absurd," said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. "They 
have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way." 
The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to 
pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to 
provide energy. 
The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The 
going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as 
Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid 
pennies on the dollar. 
Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the 
PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so 
that it no longer considered the price of natural gas. 
Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries 
-- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost 
them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Davis at Fund-Raiser as His Bill Languishes 
Critics say he should have been at Capitol

While the Assembly struggled -- and failed -- to pass a bill aimed at keeping 
hundreds of small energy generators from bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis attended 
a $10,000-a-head golf fund-raiser yesterday in Palm Desert. 
Organized by Duane Dauner, president of the California Healthcare 
Association, the event was held at Bighorn Golf Club, a luxurious private 
country club of which Dauner is a member. 
Davis' top political adviser said the governor didn't play golf, just stopped 
by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to Sacramento. 
But during Davis' absence, a bill he backed -- critical to bailing out small 
power generators -- languished in the Assembly. 
On Thursday, lawmakers canceled next week's long-planned annual trip to 
Washington, D.C., to focus on energy issues. 
"There is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course," said 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a chief 
critic of Davis and the state's utilities. "He ought to be in Sacramento to 
try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass 
in Palm Springs." 
The Democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends 
raising money for his campaign fund, money that comes from well-heeled 
interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration. 
Since becoming governor, Davis amassed $25 million by the end of 2000 -- 
averaging more than $1 million a month in contributions, often from fund- 
raisers directed at specific industries. 
Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said Davis was in Palm Springs to 
dedicate a University of California building and "dropped by a lunch" 
preceding the golf. 
South said the fund-raiser "was a diverse group of people that paid varying 
amounts of money." 
Lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues 
important to the Golden State because they didn't want to give the impression 
that "there was somewhere else more important than California," said state 
Sen. 
Don Perata, D-Oakland. 
Raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad, 
Perata said. 
"We have to be really careful because the public's patience and their 
confidence in what we're asking them to do depends on how they see us 
reacting to the problem," he said. "This will be negatively interpreted." 
Other lawmakers said the governor's top-level staff was working on the 
problem but acknowledged the golfing fund-raiser looked bad. 
"It's not the best symbolic message, but I feel we have to give him the 
benefit of the doubt," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. 
Davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast CNBC to talk about 
the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the 
state. He appeared live from Palm Springs. 
The California Healthcare Association represents nearly 500 hospitals and 
boasts on its Web site that it "influences public policy development through 
both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts." 
Last month, the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing 
education and streamline college requirements for nurses. 
One of the bills calls for spending $120 million a year on nursing classes. 
The group also is lobbying the new Department of Managed Health Care, which 
is staffed by Davis appointees, to speed up payment of $1 billion in late 
bills owed to hospitals. 
Davis signed a bill last year that gave the HMO czar the power to sanction 
health care plans for failing to pay Dauner's clients, the hospitals, on 
time. 
In his first six months in office, Davis attended a fund-raising dinner at 
Dauner's house that brought in an estimated $100,000. It was part of a spree 
that netted the governor a record-breaking $6.1 million in half a year. 
At the time, Dauner told the Los Angeles Times: "We don't talk policy at 
those kinds of things, or legislation. This was really more of a social 
event. He talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing 
education than anything else." 
Dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 23, 2001
CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930

PG&E Responds to Energy Proposals in Sacramento 
	San Francisco -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced that it 
will be forced to challenge actions now being contemplated by the State of 
California to impose new demands on its frozen rate structure. The proposed 
actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the 
entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to California's energy 
crisis at risk. 
	This week, the State has made clear its intention to use Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company's existing rate structure to begin fully paying Qualifying 
Facilities (QFs) in advance, for future power purchases, starting April 1, 
and to reimburse the Department of Water Resources (DWR) in advance of any 
other generating source, including utility-retained generation, bilateral 
contracts, QFs or the Independent System Operator (ISO). 
	"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R. 
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company. "The numbers just don't work." 
	Currently, under frozen rates, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has been 
collecting approximately $400 million per month for the purchase of electric 
power. This revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers, including 
power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals, to cover costs of 
operating our retained generation, and is insufficient to cover payments to 
the ISO and QFs. The average combined energy bill from all of these sources 
exceeds $1.4 billion a month, and may go even higher in the coming months. 
Moreover, the utility's financial condition has been further jeopardized by 
the failure of the DWR to acknowledge responsibility for the full "net open 
position," i.e. the power that must be purchased on the spot market. This 
dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional 
liabilities for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
	"We continue to work with State officials to develop a constructive, 
comprehensive solution that assures that California has a reliable and fairly 
priced supply of power. Nevertheless, we have a duty to our suppliers, 
lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility, and we must 
challenge any action by the State to force us to pay out more than is 
collected in rates," Mr. Smith concluded. 
	?

The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity

The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a 
temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled 
for no later than March 2002. 
But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent 
increase would be required to cover the debt service. 
"For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is 
admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been 
shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the 
reality as soon as possible," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek 
(Santa Cruz County). 
One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them 
out. 
And it could mean political trouble for Davis. 
"Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's 
bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002," 
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
PG&E THREATENS SUIT
The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to 
court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors. 
Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power 
generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot 
afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as 
rolling blackouts spread across the state. 
The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers 
will resume debate Monday. 
Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment 
to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has 
spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first. 
Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing 
plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern 
California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators 
provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes. 
PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the 
state for the billions it has spent purchasing power. 
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," Gordon Smith, PG&E's 
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS
According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in 
rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds 
$1. 4 billion a month. 
But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their 
own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible. 
"It's just absurd," said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. "They 
have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way." 
The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to 
pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to 
provide energy. 
The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The 
going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as 
Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid 
pennies on the dollar. 
Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the 
PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so 
that it no longer considered the price of natural gas. 
Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries 
-- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost 
them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Davis at Fund-Raiser as His Bill Languishes 
Critics say he should have been at Capitol

N171337.DTL 
While the Assembly struggled -- and failed -- to pass a bill aimed at keeping 
hundreds of small energy generators from bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis attended 
a $10,000-a-head golf fund-raiser yesterday in Palm Desert. 
Organized by Duane Dauner, president of the California Healthcare 
Association, the event was held at Bighorn Golf Club, a luxurious private 
country club of which Dauner is a member. 
Davis' top political adviser said the governor didn't play golf, just stopped 
by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to Sacramento. 
But during Davis' absence, a bill he backed -- critical to bailing out small 
power generators -- languished in the Assembly. 
On Thursday, lawmakers canceled next week's long-planned annual trip to 
Washington, D.C., to focus on energy issues. 
"There is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course," said 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a chief 
critic of Davis and the state's utilities. "He ought to be in Sacramento to 
try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass 
in Palm Springs." 
The Democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends 
raising money for his campaign fund, money that comes from well-heeled 
interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration. 
Since becoming governor, Davis amassed $25 million by the end of 2000 -- 
averaging more than $1 million a month in contributions, often from fund- 
raisers directed at specific industries. 
Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said Davis was in Palm Springs to 
dedicate a University of California building and "dropped by a lunch" 
preceding the golf. 
South said the fund-raiser "was a diverse group of people that paid varying 
amounts of money." 
Lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues 
important to the Golden State because they didn't want to give the impression 
that "there was somewhere else more important than California," said state 
Sen. 
Don Perata, D-Oakland. 
Raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad, 
Perata said. 
"We have to be really careful because the public's patience and their 
confidence in what we're asking them to do depends on how they see us 
reacting to the problem," he said. "This will be negatively interpreted." 
Other lawmakers said the governor's top-level staff was working on the 
problem but acknowledged the golfing fund-raiser looked bad. 
"It's not the best symbolic message, but I feel we have to give him the 
benefit of the doubt," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. 
Davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast CNBC to talk about 
the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the 
state. He appeared live from Palm Springs. 
The California Healthcare Association represents nearly 500 hospitals and 
boasts on its Web site that it "influences public policy development through 
both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts." 
Last month, the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing 
education and streamline college requirements for nurses. 
One of the bills calls for spending $120 million a year on nursing classes. 
The group also is lobbying the new Department of Managed Health Care, which 
is staffed by Davis appointees, to speed up payment of $1 billion in late 
bills owed to hospitals. 
Davis signed a bill last year that gave the HMO czar the power to sanction 
health care plans for failing to pay Dauner's clients, the hospitals, on 
time. 
In his first six months in office, Davis attended a fund-raising dinner at 
Dauner's house that brought in an estimated $100,000. It was part of a spree 
that netted the governor a record-breaking $6.1 million in half a year. 
At the time, Dauner told the Los Angeles Times: "We don't talk policy at 
those kinds of things, or legislation. This was really more of a social 
event. He talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing 
education than anything else." 
Dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 23, 2001
CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930

PG&E Responds to Energy Proposals in Sacramento 
	San Francisco -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced that it 
will be forced to challenge actions now being contemplated by the State of 
California to impose new demands on its frozen rate structure. The proposed 
actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the 
entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to California's energy 
crisis at risk. 
	This week, the State has made clear its intention to use Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company's existing rate structure to begin fully paying Qualifying 
Facilities (QFs) in advance, for future power purchases, starting April 1, 
and to reimburse the Department of Water Resources (DWR) in advance of any 
other generating source, including utility-retained generation, bilateral 
contracts, QFs or the Independent System Operator (ISO). 
	"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R. 
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company. "The numbers just don't work." 
	Currently, under frozen rates, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has been 
collecting approximately $400 million per month for the purchase of electric 
power. This revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers, including 
power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals, to cover costs of 
operating our retained generation, and is insufficient to cover payments to 
the ISO and QFs. The average combined energy bill from all of these sources 
exceeds $1.4 billion a month, and may go even higher in the coming months. 
Moreover, the utility's financial condition has been further jeopardized by 
the failure of the DWR to acknowledge responsibility for the full "net open 
position," i.e. the power that must be purchased on the spot market. This 
dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional 
liabilities for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
	"We continue to work with State officials to develop a constructive, 
comprehensive solution that assures that California has a reliable and fairly 
priced supply of power. Nevertheless, we have a duty to our suppliers, 
lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility, and we must 
challenge any action by the State to force us to pay out more than is 
collected in rates," Mr. Smith concluded.

Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook 
Davis favors tiered rate increases

N30195.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a so-called structured rate system. 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt 
utilities. 
If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' 
average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. 
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way. 
"We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money," said Larry 
Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. "We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use 
it, 
let's pay for it." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he 
said, "were wildly high." 
"The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, 
" Maviglio said. "Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities, you can't conclude anything." 
The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and 
Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion 
in debt. 
PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies. 
"The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall," 
said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. "Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large." 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's 
energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor. 
COST VS. OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. 
"I don't like either choice," said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store. "But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the 
blackouts." 
Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within "the existing rate structure" -- a stealthy way of saying that 
January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year 
will remain in place. 
But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. 
"For the good of California, it's inevitable," said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry 
association. 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. 
"It's like gasoline," he said. "I don't like paying higher prices for 
gasoline, but that's the price of doing business." 
Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. 
"If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it," said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty. "But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling 
blackouts." 
"I'd rather have blackouts," agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- 
repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. "I don't want to pay rates 
that are so much higher." 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way. 
Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond. 
"Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation," said Tom 
Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of 
Southern California Edison. 
Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so. 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, 
requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures. 
"It adjusts consumer behavior," Higgins said. "People want to get their bills 
back down." 
RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. 
"It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this," 
Higgins said. 
Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear: No, no, no. 
"No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals," said Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "We 
need to get back to a regulated system." 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. 
Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento. 
"We've paid too much already," Rosenfield said. "A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease." 
However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. 
"Big users should pay more," he said after a moment's reflection. "I'm open 
to a tiered system but only if it's fair." 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis. 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 
9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a 
three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months, if not longer. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. 
"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," she said. "People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more." 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The 
state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. "That way, you 
have more convenience and electricity, more stability," she said. 
But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts. 
She's moving to Texas.

CalPERS has big energy tie
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 26, 2001)

When Californians complain about energy outlaws romping through the chaotic
electricity market, carting wagonloads of money to Texas, one name often
tops the list: Enron Corp.

But at least one pretty sizeable wagon full of cash has not gone home to
energy moguls in 10-gallon hats, but rather to retired California government
workers on pensions.

For eight years, Enron has had an unusual investment partnership with the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, the fund that administers
retirement and health benefits to more than 1 million past and present
public employees.

Most recently, the two agreed in 1998 to pony up half a billion dollars each
for business ventures in energy companies, including Enron subsidiaries --
although not the one that markets electricity in California.

CalPERS and Enron have, on average, doubled their money each year. That
makes the Enron deal one of the pension fund's most lucrative.

CalPERS owns stock in thousands of companies, including high-performing
electricity generators and lagging utilities. But Enron is one of fewer than
10 companies involved in this kind of venture with the pension fund.

"Enron is one of our oldest and closest relationships here in the
alternative investment area," Barry Gonder, a CalPERS senior investment
officer, told a CalPERS committee last October. "And as you all know, it's a
highly innovative and successful company."

All true, but in California, Enron has been a major player in the
electricity market, and the company and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a
prominent supporter of President Bush, have become lightning rods for
high-voltage rage.

"Lay pockets millions every year into his personal account and now he wants
us to pay him more," a Sacramento resident asserted in a letter to The Bee
last month. " ... The power companies are reducing power to drive up prices
and put more money in the pockets of people such as Lay."

Enron has been making scads of money -- profits were up 34 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2000. But the company won't say how much of this comes
from California, and minimizes the importance of this market.

Despite the hostility toward Enron, no one has asked CalPERS about the
arrangement, said spokeswoman Patricia Macht.

Even if it did cause an outcry, CalPERS doesn't make investment decisions
based on the popularity of the companies. Even when CalPERS divested itself
of tobacco stocks recently, it justified the decision by citing lawsuits and
regulatory actions that could sour the investments.

In fact, Macht said, CalPERS is barred by its fiduciary responsibility to
its members from applying social filters that are not in keeping with their
financial best interests.

"It's a slippery slope," she said. "If we do it for energy now, what's to
say a month later, a legislator or interest group who has a beef against a
single company" might also demand that CalPERS sell its stock.

At the October meeting, CalPERS committee sessions didn't address Enron's
role in the electricity crisis. State Controller Kathleen Connell, however,
asked Andy Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, how power shortages
affected Enron's profits.

"How does Enron benefit from that, and what can you do to maximize this fuel
energy shortage, not only now but as we move into the future?" Connell
asked. She was unavailable for comment Thursday and Friday.

Consumer advocates said they were surprised to learn of the CalPERS
connection to Enron.

"I guess it's nice that some folks on retirement income get a soft landing
because they were thrown into cahoots with marauders," said Nettie Hoge of
the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, an advocacy group. But she
added, "It's a short-term return for a bargain with the devil."

The CalPERS relationship with Enron goes back to 1993, before California
even embarked on its ill-starred energy deregulation experiment.

At the time, the energy sector was out of favor with investors. CalPERS
figured that the reputation masked some good opportunities, and decided to
start putting money in energy, said Gonder, the CalPERS investment officer.
CalPERS needed a partner that understood the industry. Enron was an obvious
choice.

Enron had its own reasons to hook up with CalPERS.

The company did not respond to requests for comment. But in the October
CalPERS committee meeting, Fastow said that Enron has been investing about
$7 billion a year in the energy and communications industries. "So we need a
lot of capital," he said. Cal-

PERS, with assets of $165 billion, is one of the biggest pots of money
around.

Enron could have issued stock for the investments. But as a public company,
it has to worry about showing quick returns, Fastow said. A pension fund, he
said, could provide "more patient money."

As it turns out, CalPERS patience has not been tried. In the initial 1993
deal, Enron and Cal-PERS both kicked in $250 million. By the time CalPERS
cashed out five years later, it had earned an average yearly return of 23
percent.

"We said, 'It's working for both of us, so let's continue,'" Gonder said.

In 1998, the two created a $1 billion fund to invest in oil and gas, coal
and electricity companies -- everything from oil rigs to high-tech
electricity meters.

About $38 million of CalPERS money went to Enron Energy Services, which
sells natural gas and electricity to industrial and commercial customers and
helps them figure out better ways to keep down their energy use and costs.
Three years later, CalPERS sold the investment back to Enron for about $124
million, for a profit of $86 million.

Another investment did even better. In 1999, the partnership put up $80
million to buy some New Jersey cogeneration plants, which produce both
electricity and steam. A mere four months later, a 49 percent interest in
the plants, which cost the partnership $39.2 million, was sold to another
company for $150 million.

Each partner has invested about $300 million so far, with an average yearly
rate of return of 100 percent. The remaining money in the partnership is
expected to last another seven or eight years.

MEMORANDUM

Harvey Rosenfield has on numerous occasions threatened to place an initiative 
on the 2002 ballot to re-regulate the power industry.

It is not a hollow threat.

Not only has Rosenfield successfully placed initiatives on the ballot in the 
past, but the current energy crisis has become the number one issue on the 
minds of voters dd making it easier to qualify a ballot measure.  And our own 
internal polling for IEP shows voters would initially support the concept of 
re-regulating the industry.

However, qualifying an initiative for next year?s election is not a foregone 
conclusion.  And passing one is an even more difficult task.

Rosenfield faces several roadblocks:

o    The current energy issue is complicated, and all potential solutions 
have weaknesses that could be exploited in a political campaign.

o    IEP?s internal polling shows Rosenfield?s proposal has weaknesses that 
could be exploited dd including the price tag and the image of a state-run 
energy department that could be compared to the DMV and CalTrans.

o    Rosenfield would have a difficult time funding a campaign, especially 
raising the resources to overcome a strong, well funded "no" campaign.

o    The burden of "proof" always falls on the "yes" campaign rather than the 
"no" campaign.  Voters are concerned about giving their approval to changes 
that could make things worse.  Rosenfield will have to prove his case beyond 
a shadow of a doubt, and therefore it is easier to defeat an initiative than 
it is to pass one. 

o    If power generators become motivated they can be a formidable opponent.

Following is (1) a preliminary timeline Rosenfield would face in trying to 
qualify an initiative for the ballot in 2002, (2) strategic concepts that 
should be considered before pursuing a plan to defeat the initiative, (3) 
preliminary strategic and tactical options in opposing the initiative, and 
(4) a discussion of campaign costs.

We recommend using this outline as a starting point to develop an effective 
campaign plan that could successfully defeat Rosenfield if he pursues an 
initiative strategy.

Timeline

To date, no proposed ballot initiative has been submitted to the Attorney 
General for title and summary.  Accordingly, there is not sufficient time 
available to qualify an initiative for the March 2002 ballot.  

However, there is still adequate time to qualify a measure for the November 
2002 ballot.  We believe Rosenfield could submit a measure to the Attorney 
General as late as September, 2001 and still qualify the initiative for the 
November 2002 ballot dd especially if the summer months produce power 
blackouts, skyrocketing energy bills, and the image of a bungling Governor, 
legislature and regulators.

The following timeline would allow Rosenfield to submit language for title 
and summary as late as September 28, 2001 and qualify the initiative for the 
November 2002 ballot:

September 28, 2001

Proposed measure is submitted to the AG for title and summary.

November 20, 2001

Attorney General prepares and issues title and summary.  Proponent can begin 
circulating petitions.

April 19, 2002

The proponent files the petitions with county elections officials.

May 1, 2002

County elections officials complete petition raw count totals and certify raw 
numbers to the Secretary of State.

June 23, 2002

County elections officials verify and certify results of the number of valid 
signatures in their counties and turn in counts to the Secretary of State.

June 27, 2002

Secretary of State determines if the initiative qualifies for the ballot. 
Proponent needs 670,816 valid signatures to qualify a constitutional 
amendment or 419,260 valid signatures to qualify a straight statute.

Strategic Concepts

There are several strategic concepts that should be reviewed:

o    While satisfying Rosenfield may be impossible, IEP could push hard to 
ensure a "solution" is passed by the legislature to give credibility to the 
criticism that Rosenfield is an extremist whose initiative could undercut the 
legislative remedy.

o    The industry could organize a well-funded campaign that contains an 
early advertising blitz to quickly define the ballot measure in the most 
negative manner possible, and that delivers a knock out punch in October.

o    Generators could promote a counter-initiative proposal, either through 
the legislature or qualified by petition dd stopping Rosenfield?s proposal if 
more "yes" votes are received for the counter initiative than the Rosenfield 
measure.

o    Paid signature gathering firms could be put on contract for 
industry-related business dd thus keeping these firms off the table for 
Rosenfield.  Another variation would be to hire firms to gather signatures 
calling for legislative action dd thus gaining names of voters who support 
our position, but also keeping signature gatherers too busy to help 
Rosenfileld. 

o    The industry could pay to gather signatures on petitions that removes 
names of people who may have signed the petition for Rosenfield?s 
initiative.  This could cut down the number of valid signatures accepted by 
county election officials.

o    A paid advertising campaign could be run during the proposal?s signature 
gathering phase urging voters not to sign the petitions.  An added benefit of 
the concept is defining the proposal early if it still qualifies for the 
ballot. 

o    We could organize a legal assault on the proposal dd stopping their 
signature gathering efforts or keeping it off the ballot.

Campaign Strategy

If the proposal qualifies for the ballot, the industry must pursue an 
aggressive strategy to defeat the measure.  We need to identify weaknesses in 
the proposal and share those weaknesses with voters.  We must also push 
voters to question the motives behind the initiative.  We need to make sure 
voters are uncomfortable with all or portions of the initiative to ensure 
they vote no despite wanting adequate and affordable energy.

The campaign should conduct thorough research to determine the best strategy 
to defeat the measure.  Initially we believe the "no" campaign should focus 
on testing and developing the following messages:

o    The measure will hurt taxpayers.  A $40 billion price tag is too much 
for voters to accept as the only solution to the problem.

o    The proposal will hurt public services.  The cost of Rosenfield?s 
measure will keep money away from more important programs  dd like schools, 
public safety and programs for children and seniors.

o    The ballot measure is simply a way for elected officials to get more tax 
dollars to cover up their failures dd and they should not be rewarded with 
public support.

o    Rosenfield?s proposal will result in higher taxes to pay for more 
bureaucracy and wasted tax dollars.

o    The proposal will result in more inefficient government that will 
produce unreliable power dd hurting consumers, and vital services such as 
hospitals and public safety.

o    The measure will hurt the economy and cost jobs at a time when the 
economy is hurting.

Campaign Tactics 

The campaign should follow an aggressive battleplan that includes the 
following components:

Research

Focus groups and quantitative surveys should be conducted to help craft the 
best messages to attack the proposal.  This research would also be important 
in efforts to secure the most favorable ballot title and summary possible to 
our goal of defeating it.

Demographic and election research should also be conducted to determine 
voters most open to our campaign messages.  We should also conduct thorough 
research on Rosenfield to expose his true motivations for proposing this 
measure and its inherent weaknesses.

Legal, Title & Summary, and Ballot Argument Challenges

We should pursue every possible legal option to either get the proposal off 
the ballot, or ensure the most favorable title & summary and weakened ballot 
arguments for the initiative sponsors.  Our experience shows that the ballot 
title and summary can swing initial vote margins either way by as much as 10 
points.

Paid Advertising

Statewide campaigns in California require paid advertising dd including 
electronic media, direct mail, and telemarketing.  Advertising should be 
carefully targeted to ensure the most "bang for the buck."

Earned Media

Editorial support is an important part of successful statewide campaigns, as 
is ensuring favorable media coverage of the campaign.  A focused earned media 
campaign would greatly enhance the chances for success and editorial support 
and Op-Ed?s can provide important third party credibility to the no campaign.

Coalition Building

It will be critical for the industry to gain credible allies in its fight 
against Rosenfield.  We do not want the campaign to be portrayed as 
generators versus consumer groups.  Therefore, we need credible, third party 
groups standing along side us to broaden our appeal and message, like 
taxpayer groups, business leaders, consumer organizations, energy experts, 
economists, educators, law enforcement and seniors.

Campaign Costs

How much will be needed to defeat Rosenfield will depend on several factors.  
Depending on several variables, the cost of a "no" campaign can range from a 
few million dollars to as much as the $40 million spent to defeat Proposition 
9.  

Campaign costs to defeat ballot measures are contingent upon several 
variables:

o    The popularity of the measure with voters.  The more they like it on the 
natural, the more expensive it will be to defeat the measure.

o    How much money Rosenfield can raise to promote the measure.  If he has 
few resources, the "no" campaign will have an uncontested paid advertising 
campaign, which will make defeating the proposal much easier.

o    How bad the energy crisis impacts voters.  If the next 15 months produce 
an on-going crisis, campaign costs will rise.

o    The effectiveness of messages against the proposal.  If focus group and 
survey research confirm the proposal has an Achilles heel, the cost to defeat 
the measure will go down dramatically.

Thorough research of Rosenfield?s actual proposal will better enable us to 
recommend a campaign plan, message and budget.  In summary, defeating the 
Rosenfield initiative will cost from a few to several million dollars and a 
united industry effort.

SoCalGas to Make System Enhancements
Southern California Gas Co. confirmed plans to expand its intrastate gas 
transportation system and make enhancements to its storage facilities to help 
meet record-setting gas demand by electric generators in Southern California. 
SoCalGas Chairman Edwin A. Guiles informed California Public Utilities 
Commission President Loretta Lynch of the plans in a March 27 letter. 
He said the company had begun modifications to its system that will allow it 
to deliver an additional 175 MMcf/d by year end. SoCal's Lad Lorenz told NGI 
last week the company was planning to increase receipt point capacity at 
Wheeler Ridge where it interconnects with Kern River and Mojave, at the 
Needles compressor station where it interconnects with Transwestern Pipeline 
and at a receipt point for in-state production in the San Joaquin Valley (see 
Daily GPI, March 23 
<http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010323g.html>). The 
Topock, AZ, border delivery point, which saw the sharpest price increases 
this winter, was not among the points slated for expansion because of the 
cost of expanding there. The company plans to add 85 MMcf/d of capacity at 
Wheeler Ridge, 50 MMcf/d at Needles and 40 MMcf/d for in-state production. 
"We are taking immediate action to increase compression horsepower at three 
delivery stations to boost the amount of natural gas that can be transported 
into The Gas Company's intrastate pipeline system," said Guiles. "In light of 
the uncertainties surrounding future demand for natural gas on The Gas 
Company's system, these modifications are the least cost way that we can be 
assured of meeting the gas demands of all of our customers and avoid any 
possibility for curtailments of service." Guiles said the proposed 5% 
increase in capacity would be enough to serve another 1.3 million residential 
customers per day or to power 1,200 MW of new baseload electric generation. 
"The improvements are consistent with SoCalGas' goals of maintaining as much 
as 20% more capacity than our requirements for periods of normal demand," he 
said. 
SoCalGas also is proposing some adjustments to its gas storage operations 
that will help increase the in-state supply of natural gas by 24 Bcf - or 
enough gas to serve a half million residential customers for one year - over 
the next year. It already has on file at the CPUC plans to abandon the 
Montebello storage field in Los Angeles County and withdraw the 10-12 Bcf of 
base and working gas that remains in the field. In addition, the company is 
planning to drill several new wells at its Aliso Canyon and La Goleta storage 
fields in order to remove 14 Bcf of base gas, split evenly between the two 
fields, and sell it into the market. The reduction in base gas is expected to 
have no impact on the amount of working gas capacity available in each field. 
Because of strong gas demand last summer, the levels of natural gas at the 
company's underground storage reservoirs reached near historic lows this 
winter. The LDC is encouraging non-core shippers to get a head start on 
storage injections this year because it expects demand to remain strong in 
2001. 
"Our goal for this year is to have no curtailments of gas service to our 
customers, but we need to maximize the use of our existing intrastate 
capacity in order to reach our goal," said Guiles. "We're telling our large 
industrial and electric generation customers that the best way that they can 
avoid curtailments next winter is to make full use of the available pipeline 
space and put natural gas in storage whenever possible, particularly during 
the second quarter of this year. 
"I believe that, if undertaken, these proposals will have a positive impact 
on reliability next winter," said Guiles. 

I can cover S.D. and San Jose if needed.

Jeff

US House panel sets April hearings on Calif crisis 

     The hearings will take place on April 10 in Sacramento, April 11 in San 
Jose, and April 12 in San Diego. 

     California, which has struggled to keep the lights on since last autumn, 
is widely expected to face blackouts during the peak power demand months of 
the summer. On Tuesday, state regulators approved an average 40 percent 
increase in consumer electricity rates to cover the soaring cost of energy 
and pump more cash into the state's near-bankrupt utilities. 

     "The energy crisis in California has ramifications for the entire 
country, and it looks like it's going to get worse before it gets better," 
Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who heads the panel, said in a 
statement. 

     "The problems are costing California's economy billions of dollars, and 
that's going to affect the economy of the entire country," he added. 

     The committee will hear testimony from power generators, utilities, 
government entities, and local organizations. 

     Neighboring states have complained that California's thirst for power 
has boosted wholesale electricity prices throughout the western region, 
forcing some energy-intensive businesses like paper mills and mines to 
temporarily close. 

Agreed.  Now let's see if Bowen et al can just pass the darn thing.

Jeff

HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger

BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein

BODY:

??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide
convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and
strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis 
fails
to clean up the power mess.

??"All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to
have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the
governor will have on the ticket up and down," said state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Alameda. "If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that
could be problematic."

??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the
state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters 
understand
Davis didn't create the problem.

??"It won't be solved in six months," South said. "This is an immediate 
problem
that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year 
process
to get this situation back under control."

??As for the governor's critics, "I think they should be asked to produce 
their
own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read 
about
in the newspapers have no plan."

??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the
frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political
damage.

??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a
Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried
California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the 
state's
congressional delegation.

??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally
and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention
for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised 
to
make the hallmark of his first term.

??But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor
will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the
convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight.

??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California
Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento
who won't be attending to quip, "We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We 
don't
need to go to Disneyland for that."

??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled 
the
events of the past week. "In many ways, he appears to have gone politically 
tone
deaf," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate
University. "His instincts are not serving him well."

??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them 
that
a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis,
Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money
for his re-election campaign.

??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week
approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for 
months,
Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and
that he thought it was premature.

??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. "I'm
glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some
of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight
weeks," said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. "There's a high level of
frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is."

??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the
governor's control. "No one can predict with any certainty where this is going
to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under
control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to
do."

??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and 
Democrats
remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was
pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are
blocking efforts to cap prices.

??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted
Davis could weather the electricity crisis. "People who are following it know
it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't
have any plausible alternatives," he said.

??"My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy
solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't
necessarily take it out on (Davis)."

??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare,
pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.

??"The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing
cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the
personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are," he said.
"That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this
summer."

You're sweet.  I'm responding from under a palapas.   (From yesterday's 1:30 
call, I see much ain't changed 
since I left. :)

Welcome back.  We did send the Analysis Memo last week to all, with some
small difficulty discerning correct email addresses for the various
folks.  Please let us know if anyone did not get their copy.

You have several electronic version of interconnection agreements for
California, and we can discuss at your convenience.  The process for
adopting an agreement "as is" is fairly straightforward in Calif and
will not take that long (a few weeks).

We are also filing updated pages for tariffs, including substantive
service changes which Steve mentioned.  We can show you any documents
before filing (9/5/00 is the last day).

Please feel free to let us know any questions,

to discuss amendments to SB 28x to make it more comprehensive.  I will
report to IEP and members the results of the meeting in my weekly
legislative status report tomorrow.

- IEP has an appointment with Asm. Cox on Tuesday at 8:30 am.  The message
to him is support linking SB 28x and a direct access bill with SB 5x, and
oppose =01&California first=018 language and changes to the outage and main=

coordination (i.e., AB 60x, AB 8x, and SB 39x).  IEP members are invited to
join.  Please let me know if you are going to attend.  I will report to IEP
members the results of the meeting.

- In the meantime, since SB 28x is likely to be heard on Monday, all
available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members of
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee to support SB 28x with
the caveat that we would like to see some additional changes.

Discussion re: AB 60x (Hertzberg)

- Available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members o=

the Senate Energy Committee to oppose AB 60x.  The message is twofold: 1)
the bill creates another obstacle in the siting process when the state
should be streamlining it; and, 2) as a net-importer, California would be
sending the wrong signals to its neighboring states that send us power in
our time of need.  I will forward under separate cover the agreed-upon
amendments that we would be willing to live with if we can=01,t kill the bi=

RECENT EVENTS:

-- SB 28x (Sher/Battin), which makes various changes to the siting process
including many IEP-sponsored proposals, passed off the Senate floor last
week 37 to 1.  Asm. Wright=01,s office is now working with the authors and =
IEP
to make additional changes to the bill, as opposed to moving more siting
issues in AB 36x (Wright) (although that is still an option).  Chris Elliso=
n
and I are continuing to work with the authors=01, staff to develop addition=
al
language. The bill is scheduled to be heard on Monday in the Assembly Energ=
y
Costs and Availability Committee.  We are waiting to review new language
from the author=01,s office.  At this point we are recommending the bill do=
es
NOT move forward without this additional language.  I will let members know
the status of these amendments before the hearing.

-- IEP has a meeting with the newly-elected Assembly Republican Leader Dave
Cox (Sacramento) on Tuesday at 8:30 am to discuss the Republican=01,s posit=
ion
on siting and direct access, and possibly linking those issues with the
passage SB 5x (Sher), the billion dollar energy conservation bill on the
Assembly side.  Although they are not the only issues IEP and its members
want resolved in this legislative session, they are currently the most
visible and active issues with the best chance of passage.

-- AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement tha=
t
a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California
entities, is out of the Assembly on a 64 to 12 vote.  The bill will be hear=
d
in the Senate Energy Committee next.  IEP members have agreed on amendments
to the bill which it will present to the Speaker, however, it and its
members will be meeting with members of the Senate Energy Committee to stop
the bill.  IEP=01,s opposition message is twofold: 1) the bill creates anot=
her
obstacle in the siting process when the state should be streamlining it;
and, 2) as a net-importer, California would be sending the wrong signals to
its neighboring states that send us power in our time of need.

-- AB 8x (Migden), which would have given the EOB additional and undefined
powers related to the coordination of operation and maintenance schedules,
was gutted in the Senate last week and used as a vehicle for the State to
get the generation component of the utilities=01, rates, the San Diego rate=
 cap
extended to all customers, and kicking the QF issue to the CPUC.  AB 8x in
its new form, authored by Assembly Member Keeley, passed out of the Senate,
but failed to get enough Republicans to vote for the bill on the Assembly
floor.  The biggest opposition came primarily from the gas-fired QFs which
wanted to be exempt from the measure=01,s QF provisions.

Migden=01,s office has communicated its intention to move forward with the
language previously in AB 8x, although in a different vehicle not yet
identified.  There remains a commitment on the table to meet with IEP to
discuss amendments.  IEP member company lobbyists have agreed to continue
lobbying her office to urge her to wait hearing the bill again until this
meeting has happened.

-- There appears as if there is going to be another attempt at moving QF
legislation next week.  SB 66x (Bowen) was introduced on Wednesday in which
a Senate Floor analysis was already prepared.  The measure is still in
spot-bill format, but rumor has it =01&they=018 are working on language as =
we
speak.  Be prepared for anything.

-- Senator Burton=01,s office is sending IEP another set of amendments
attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x
(Burton), which is the state power authority measure.  I will report on the
status of these amendments once we have had a chance to review them.

-- SB 39x (Speier), which would define generators as public utilities and
put the CPUC in the role of coordinating outages and maintenance schedules,
remains on the Senate floor awaiting a vote.  There is no action item on
this measure at this time.

-- Regular session is getting under way in conjunction with the on-going
special session hearings.  IEP has taken a support position on the followin=
g
bills which are scheduled for hearings next week:  SB 64x (Costa), which
expands to Biomass-to-Energy grant program; AB 49x (Campbell), AB 226
(Campbell), and SB 30x (Brulte), each of which would allocate property tax
revenues from new power plants exclusively to the residing local government=
;
and, AB 1138 (LaSuer), which in its introduced form would provide
low-interest loans for repower projects and peaker plants, with specified
conditions.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
of any of these bills.

Davis Blames Crisis On State Republicans 
But Democratic controller points at governor 
Carla Marinucci, John Wildermuth, Chronicle Political Writers
Sunday, April 1, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL:

N154353.DTL 
Anaheim -- The politics of energy dominated the state Democratic convention 
yesterday, as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to embattled Gov. 
Gray Davis, who clashed bitterly with party rival, Controller Kathleen 
Connell. 
Speaking at the Anaheim convention center, where dimmed lights were a 
constant reminder of yesterday's Stage 2 alert, Davis blamed California's 
energy woes on former Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican lawmakers and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, which, he charged, has failed to regulate 
greedy energy firms selling power at "out of control prices." 
He insisted that he was not sure rate increases were necessary, refusing to 
say whether he would support huge hikes backed by the Public Utilities 
Commission last week. He suggested, however, that he favors a system of 
tiered electricity pricing. 
"These Republicans -- who were so enamored with deregulation just five years 
ago -- have become even more enamored with criticizing me as I try to clean 
up their mess," the governor said to tepid applause from the 1,900 delegates. 
"This deregulation disaster was authored by a Republican legislator, 
passed by a Republican Assembly, signed into law by a Republican governor and 
implemented with undue haste by a Republican PUC." 
But the governor's Republican-bashing was overshadowed politically by an 
attack by state Controller Connell, a candidate for Los Angeles mayor -- who 
rejected what she called Davis' "finger-pointing" and assailed his handling 
of the crisis. The dramatic development demonstrated both deepening rifts 
within California's ruling party and the high political stakes of the energy 
crisis. 
"There will be no excuses for Democrats in this state, because we dominate 
state government," Connell said in a convention speech in which she also 
outlined proposals to require "power hogs," such as malls, to install their 
own microgenerators. 
"I spent the past eight years making sure the state had a surplus, and now 
I'm seeing it eaten away every day by energy costs. . . . Whatever solution 
(the governor) provides must come fast and be shared openly with the people 
of California," she said in a dig at Davis, who has been criticized for 
moving too cautiously and for resisting disclosure of energy contracts to the 
public. 
Warning of the costs of "a delay and an incremental approach to an indefinite 
problem," she said, "I won't stand by and allow the consumers to pick up the 
tab." 
DAVIS DEFENDS POLICIES
Asked to respond to Connell's critique, Davis told reporters, "I believe 
we've moved at warp speed to address this problem. . . . We've kept the light 
on most days." 
The governor, who endorsed Connell's opponent, former Assembly Speaker 
Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor, then added, "It might be if she's not happy 
with that, she can run for governor next time." 
Garry South, the governor's senior political adviser, was even more caustic, 
lambasting Connell as a party infidel. "This is why Kathleen Connell doesn't 
have a friend in all Los Angeles," he said. "She's been picking on the 
governor since day one." 
"It's all air," he said of her talk. "Not only hot air but a foul wind." 
In an interview while campaigning later in the day, Connell toughened her 
rhetoric, saying, "The emperor has no more clothes here in California." 
"We are well into the fifth month (of the energy crisis) and we have yet to 
find any answers from the administration," said Connell, who promised to 
release her own detailed solutions to the crisis next week. 
Unlike many Democrats at the convention, festooned with "Wilson Did It" 
signs, she rejected as "irrelevant" the suggestion by Davis that Republicans 
were to blame for California's energy woes. 
"Californians are wearying of this finger-pointing and closed-door 
negotiations and extended debate," she told The Chronicle. "The public is no 
longer going to be patient with us. They're going to hold the governor 
accountable when they get the bill." 
CONNELL LAGGING IN POLL
Connell, who is forced by term limits to give up her post as controller next 
year, has lagged in her campaign to become mayor of Los Angeles. With 10 days 
to the election, a recent poll showed her running fourth behind City Attorney 
James Hahn, Villaraigosa and businessman Steve Soboroff. 
Despite Davis' words and speculation among delegates, Connell denied she was 
eyeing the governor's seat for the future. "I'm not looking two or three 
years down the line," she said. "But I hope the governor is looking toward an 
immediate solution to this problem." 
The governor's speech was his first since the PUC announced rate increases of 
as much as 46 percent. Davis refused to say whether he would support the 
immediate rate increase approved by the PUC but suggested that he would back 
a tiered billing system. 
"If a rate increase becomes absolutely necessary to keep our lights on and 
our economy strong, you can be sure of one thing from this governor," Davis 
said. "I'll fight to protect those least able to pay, reward those who 
conserve the most and 'motivate' those who are the biggest guzzlers to cut 
back." 
He later dodged reporters' questions about specifics, repeatedly saying that 
within the next two weeks he would release a statement detailing "what, if 
any" increases were needed. 
"Many advisers from Wall Street are running numbers, and they appear to be 
different from the PUC's," he said. 
Davis also said he has already done a lot to address the crisis and had "kick 
started" construction of new power plants and successfully promoted 
conservation programs. 
Some of Davis' backers at the convention, watching the squabbling, expressed 
concern about some of the governor's tactics. 
"People want a leader to lead," said Susan Leal, San Francisco's city 
treasurer. "They're looking for someone to come out and take command, 
regardless of who started this." 
But, she said, Davis is a tough and smart politician, and "people are still 
going to be forgiving if (the governor) does something to attack the 
problem." 
OTHER DEMOCRATS BLAME GOP
Other Democratic Party leaders were also quick to defend Davis and to blame 
Republicans. 
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, suggested 
that President Bush has ignored California's energy problems because "he's 
worried to death about Davis running for president." 
California is the world's sixth-biggest economy, McAuliffe noted in an 
interview, and Bush "has basically written it off, saying, 'Good luck to you. 
You're not getting any help.' " 
Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Davis "is attacked 
every day by the backbench Republican yahoos in the Legislature" and 
predicted that public concern over energy would ebb by next year's election. 
"We're looking at issues that are going to transcend the energy issues we see 
now," Torres said, such as crime and violence in the schools, economics, the 
environment and abortion. 
But political analyst Sherry Bebich Jeffee said Connell's criticism was 
evidence of a party split and perhaps "the opening salvo in 2002," when Davis 
is up for re-election. 
Davis's entire party, she said, could be in trouble if voters get fed up with 
higher energy bills. 
"Do the math," said Jeffee, noting that Democrats hold all but one state 
office and control of the both houses of the Legislature. "If you're going to 
throw the bums out, the bums in this state are mostly Democrats."

Attached is the draft that we've discussed.  Few points:

It's a draft.  It would benefit from more tinkering.
It takes our core messages (what's the problem?  what's the solution?) and 
tries to weave in current events, understanding that by the time you're 
giving the presentation it may need to be further modified to correspond with 
rapidly changing circumstances and events.
It's frank but (hopefully) measured in describing the mess that is 
California.  It's set up so that it's easy to modify the more pointed 
statements.
Leaves plenty of room for you to tailor the presentation to particular points 
that you'd like to make, or data and/or information that you'd like to 
include.
I didn't have ready access to charts and graphs to back up the stats used in 
the text of the presentation, but I'm sure that it will be relatively easy 
for someone in Houston to pull that together (e.g., may want to poach a bit 
from Belden's presentation to include some PNW hydro stats (which I've also 
attached), or from ISO website to show load-resource balance info).
Though I'll be on vacation, I'll be checking in on voicemail and email, so if 
you have any questions, or need something additional to get the presentation 
ready, just let me know.
I may be in an airplane on Monday during both the leadership call and the 
newly restructured California call.  Otherwise, I'll be trying to make those 
calls dailywhile I'm away. 
And Jim, I'll also be available to participate in any calls regarding 
Calger's proposed deal with CDWR.
Finally, when the darn thing prints out, it prints borders around the 
heading/title box and the text box, though I don't know why.  Tried just 
about everything to get rid of them.  May want to have a PP guru in Houston 
see if (s)he can disable the boders.

Jeff

Hi Jason:

Per my voice mail, here's the package of materials for customers to use to 
make sure key policy makers know that maintaining customer choice in 
California is critical.  As I mentioned in the voice mail, the Legislature's 
likely to move this week on a variety of fronts, so it's important that the 
business community make its voice heard immediately and clearly.  If you 
could forward this along to the SVMG members, it would be very helpful to the 
fight for cusomer choice and greatly appreciated.  Information on how to 
contact the key legislators is included.  Also included are "form" letters 
that folks can print out, sign, and send.  If you have any questions, don't 
hesitate to give me a call at 415.782.7822.

Jeff

My understanding is that it's languishing but still has a decent chance of 
getting through.  The question is when.  I'll try to get some more firm 
information and get back to you later in the afternoon.

Any news from the litigation front with UC/CSU?

This should help Prentice's chances for employment come the Fall.  You guys 
should have a HUGE phone bill on your room charges.  Please fax me a copy of 
the bill.  I will cover all phone charges.  Also, please forward to me what I 
owe you for the plane flight and golf and our share of dinners, drinks, 
guacamole, etc.

We played spades at the airport.  My team lost..........again.  My losing 
streak now ties DiMaggio's hitting streak.

#7 RANKING FOR HAAS SCHOOL IS BEST EVER IN LATEST US NEWS BUSINESS SCHOOL 
SURVEY 
The Haas School of Business was ranked the 7th best business school in the 
United States in the latest annual survey of American graduate schools by US 
News and World Report magazine.  This is the best showing ever by the school 
in the history of the US News ranking, which was released Friday. 

US News also ranked the Haas School's Evening MBA Program the 8th best in the 
country, unchanged from last year.  The full-time MBA Program was number 10 
in last year's ranking, up from 14th place the year before.

The rankings appear in the April 9 issue; copies are available on newsstands 
today. The rankings and related stories are also available on line at 
http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/beyond/bchome.htm.

"We are always pleased when a ranking reflects the reality we live every day, 
which is that the Haas School is a world-class institution, with faculty and 
students who are extraordinarily innovative and accomplished and, 
consequently, very much in demand by every type of major business and 
academic organization, everywhere on earth," said Jay Stowsky, associate dean 
for school affairs and initiatives. 

Several specialty programs at Haas were also ranked among the top 10 
nationwide in a part of the US News survey that is based on the opinions of 
deans and MBA Program heads. They include: finance (10th); general management 
(8th); entrepreneurship (10th); marketing (8th); quantitative analysis (8th); 
and nonprofit organizations (7th).

In addition, the Haas School's graduate program in health management was 
ranked the 7th best program in the country.

The full-time MBA program ranking is based on a weighted average of eight 
measures of academic quality that fall into three major categories: 
reputation (40 percent); placement success (35 percent); and student 
selectivity (25 percent).

CLASSES START TODAY FOR NEW MASTER'S IN FINANCIAL ENGINEERING DEGREE AT HAAS 
For 49 students classes start today for the Master's in Financial Engineering 
(MFE), a new graduate degree program at the Haas School of Business. Of the 
49 students, 6 are taking the program to earn a concurrent degree with the 
MBA program, combining the in-depth study of financial economics and the 
dynamics of markets with the general management education of the MBA program. 
  
The class of 2002 is represented by an international group of highly educated 
scientists and professionals: 
The inaugural class represents 19 countries: 7 students come from China, 6 
come from Canada, 5 from Korea, and 5 come from five different European 
countries. Also represented are South America (Chile and Colombia), Africa 
(Zimbabwe), and Southeast Asia (India and Indonesia), as well as Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, Russia, and the Republic of Georgia. 
Top professions include finance (25%), engineering (18%), and research & 
development (11%) 
18% hold a Ph.D. and 25% hold a master's degree in another field. 
One fourth of the class performed in the top percentile of the GMAT. 
The Haas MFE is the first such degree program in the United States that is 
offered entirely under the auspices of a business school. It is also the 
first US program to require its students to take a three-month internship at 
a top financial firm as part of the learning experience. The Haas MFE program 
will prepare candidates with superior analytical skills for a growing niche 
of quantitative finance careers.

MFE candidates will train for positions as risk managers, investment bankers, 
asset managers, derivatives traders, and developers of specialized securities 
at the world's leading commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, 
and corporate and public treasury departments. 

Founding sponsors include some of the world's top financial firms, namely AIG 
Inc., Barclays Global Investors, BARRA Inc., Gifford Fong Associates, Goldman 
Sachs & Co., First Union Bank, KMV LLC, MBIA Inc., Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, Quantal International Inc., The Dean Witter Foundation, and WR 
Hambrecht + Co., LLC. Sponsoring firms will be accepting interns from the 
programs. 

"We're seeing tremendous interest among talented individuals coming from 
technical backgrounds, such as engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, who 
are in narrow jobs and are keen to transition to a brand new career where 
opportunities are abundant and continue to grow," says MFE Executive Director 
John O'Brien.

SHARING OUR STRENGTHS: THE HAAS/BOALT CONNECTION

This is the first in a continuing series of articles in Haas NewsWire 
chronicling the Haas School's interdisciplinary activities. 
The Haas School has traditionally pursued interdisciplinary partnerships on 
the Berkeley campus. During her tenure as dean, Laura Tyson has made it her 
priority to increase Haas' partnerships in the areas of teaching, research, 
and public service with other disciplines. One of the most vibrant of these 
is with the Boalt School of Law. 

"Haas faculty are well known for their path-breaking work on competitive 
strategy in the Internet age, and Boalt is recognized for having the 
strongest intellectual property law faculty in the country, particularly as 
regards IP questions arising in cyberspace," said Jay Stowsky, associate dean 
for school affairs and initiatives. "The collection, in one place, at the 
same time, of so many notable scholars in an area of rich intellectual 
ferment and intense public interest is an extraordinary intellectual 
opportunity.  We intend to expand that opportunity through increased 
interaction between the two schools."

The area of business law doesn't fit easily into just a law school or a 
business school, but the interdisciplinary approach between the Haas School 
of Business and Boalt Hall School of Law fills this gap. From creating joint 
courses to hosting conferences, Haas and Boalt are shaping a dynamic 
partnership that will serve both schools in the future. 

This partnership isn't new. Since 1968, Haas and Boalt have offered a joint 
JD/MBA degree to more than 138 UC Berkeley students (Haas also offers a 
JD/MBA with Hastings). In addition to the joint degree program, Haas and 
Boalt students are sharing classrooms when the topic calls for it. 

Adjunct Professor Leo Helzel and Lecturer Noel Nellis have offered "Top Down 
Law" for six years to law and business students.  Helzel describes the course 
as, "what a CEO needs to know to stay in business."  The class brings in 
practicing lawyers and business people to lecture on their specialties. 
"Business students should be exposed to the broader legal framework in which 
companies operate," says Helzel. Helzel and Nellis have also organized two 
debates on the Microsoft antitrust case, bringing experts from both Haas and 
Boalt to take sides on the issue.

The Business and Public Policy group offered one course, "Law and Strategy of 
E-Commerce," in fall 2000 with Boalt. Pablo Spiller, the Joe Shoong Professor 
of International Business and Public Policy and the chair of the Business and 
Public Policy Group, taught the course along with Robert P. Merges, the 
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati Distinguished Professor of Law and 
Technology and a director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology.  In 
the fall 2001, Rui de Figueiredo, assistant professor in the Business and 
Public Policy Group, will teach "Deals" with Howard Shelanski, acting 
professor of law, to both business and law students.  

The Management of Technology (MOT) Program is sponsoring two evening 
conferences at Haas this spring organized with Peter Menell, professor of 
law. The first on "Television-Internet Convergence" took place on March 14 in 
Arthur Andersen Auditorium. On April 18 the second annual Boalt Hall/MOT 
Conference on Digital Music takes place in the Arthur Andersen Auditorium 
beginning at 4:00 pm. 

"Partnering with Boalt just makes so much sense when we're exploring issues 
of technology, business, and intellectual property," says Andrew Isaacs, the 
executive director of MOT. "The connections are there. Having BoaIt literally 
next door is a fantastic resource." 

An academic conference, "Beyond Microsoft: Antitrust, Technology, and 
Intellectual Property" organized by Mark Lemley, professor of law and a 
director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, took place at Haas and 
Boalt on March 2 and 3.  Sponsored by the Institute of Management, 
Innovation, and Organization (IMIO) and the Institute of Business and 
Economics Research (IBER), the conference included a presentation by Carl 
Shapiro, the Transamerica Professor of Business Strategy and the director of 
IBER, and participation by Dean Tyson and Professor Michael Katz. 

All of this hard work builds the base for long-term future collaborations, 
says Stowsky, "In addition to enhancing the traditional training of both 
managers and lawyers in the intricacies of business law, the increased 
collaboration positions UC Berkeley to become the leading center of academic 
research and policy analysis related to the economic, legal, social, and 
political impacts of the Internet." 
HAAS ADVISORY BOARD CONVENES FOR SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING 
This Friday, Haas will host a group of high-level CEOs, presidents, chairs, 
and company founders as the members of the Haas Advisory Board gather for 
their semi-annual meeting. The 60 plus member board, which includes 
representatives from major companies in almost every field of business, 
brings knowledge of best business practices to the Haas planning process. The 
current chairman, Roger Siboni, BS 76, is president and CEO of E.piphany. 

Since December 2000 Dean Laura Tyson has recruited five new members to the 
Advisory Board: 
Margo Alexander, BS 68, chairman & CEO of Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management, 
the asset management subsidiary of PaineWebber Incorporated.  She is also a 
member of the Board of Directors for PaineWebber Incorporated.  
Kim Fisher, MBA 94, co-founder and CEO of AudioBasket.com, a service for 
personalized, broadcast-quality audio programming through web sites and 
wireless service providers.  Prior to AudioBasket, Fisher worked for Motorola 
Network Ventures, a division of Motorola that invests in international 
wireless, paging, and Internet service providers. 
Arun Sarin, MBA 79, is the former chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc., 
the leading global Internet infrastructure company.  He joined InfoSpace in 
May 2000 from Vodafone AirTouch, where he served as CEO of the US and Asia 
Pacific regions. 
Trevor Traina, MBA 96, is an entrepreneur and private investor.  Most 
recently he was a group manager in Microsoft's MSN Internet division.  
Previously, he was the president and founder of Compare.Net, the leading 
buyer's guide on the Internet.  
John Williford, MBA 80, is the president and chief executive officer of Menlo 
Logistics and a senior vice president for CNF Transportation Inc. Williford 
is also responsible for managing CNF's operations in support of its contract 
to sort and move Priority Mail for the U.S. Postal Service. 
On the agenda: faculty research, possibilities for new degree programs, and 
the upcoming Tokyo Symposium.

Jeff/Janel/Paul -- I was just thinking about influential people to contact 
our top 5 legislators plus Davis...  Besides the Silicon Valley CEOs, Mike 
Peevey is pretty tight with and trusted by Davis.  When we met w/ Peevey, he 
told us he was in agreement on direct access -- how about a call to him 
asking him to weigh in w/ Davis.  Also, Peevey's wife is a freshman 
assemblywoman (Carol Liu, I think).  So I think Peevey is a key influential.  
What do you think? kd

Thanks a million.  Do you think that you're boss is inclinded to put a call 
in to the governor regarding the importance of choice and/or sign and send 
letters to the leadership?  Also, what was the name of the association you 
forwarded the package to?  Thanks again.

Jeff---
I am confused.
I thought the SDG&E rate freeze was now wrapped up with 3 other pieces of 
legislation in ABX 8?
Now, I see it below....still as the Alpert bill....SBX 43.

Please give me the low-down.
Thank you.

Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg has circulated the following list of
priority bills which he would like to pass out of the Assembly this
week:

SBX 5 (Sher) - This bill provides a total of $1, 039,500,000 from the
General Fund to implement energy efficiency programs and supplement
existing energy efficiency programs.

SBX 43 (Alpert) - This bill extends the SDG&E rate freeze to users over
100kw.

ABX 29 (Kehoe) - This bill This bill creates a variety of new programs
relating to energy
efficiency and distributed generation.

SBX 6 (Burton) - This bill creates the California Consumer Power and
Conservation Financing Authority (CPCFA), (2) authorizes the issuance of
bonds up to $5 billion, and (3) specifies that the CPCFA shall not
undertake any new projects after January 1, 2007.

SBX 28 (Sher)   This bill contains a series of provisions intended to
accommodate increased construction and operation of power plants.  The
bill also provides a 10-year waiver of standby charges for specified
distributed generation (DG) installations.

I apologize----worked on it Sunday evening thinking that I could finish up 
yesterday in the office (fat chance).  Here's what I've done thus far, and 
I'll continue to edit today, if that would be helpful.

Best,
Jeff

comment on what you think  is missing -- wrong --    or   unbelievable   !!!  
thanks  so  much... Margaret

Thanks a million (as always).  Give my best to Ray and tell him to hurry up 
and get this messed resolved.

I'll call.

Ken's already strapped for time and we've giving him an aggressive list of 
CEOs to call (he probably won't make more than a handful of calls).  If you 
could call Peevey, that would be great.

Yes.  And I'd be happy to call him and harass him.  Better yet, if Ken Lay's 
willing to call him and harass him, that'd be better still.

Jeff:

Keep up the good work on this information scramble.  Any further word on SBX 
9 ?  Also, can you add me to your voluminous distribution list?  Thanks.

Jay

The Distributed Energy Resources industry won a major battle yesterday.  The 
California Senate Energy and Utilities Committee passed on a 7-0 bipartisan 
vote, Sen. Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this bill, it was as much 
Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff that discriminates against 
DER.  SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus DER bill SBX 35 which is still alive 
and contains many important provisions fro removing additional barriers.  
Yesterday's vote represents a major win because even if the bill ultimately 
does not get enacted, a very important statement has been made by the 
committee.  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their proceedings.
 
The DER community owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the 
Utilities Committee Members and their staffs:
Sen. Bowen (Chair)
Sen. Alarcon
Sen. Battin
Sen. Dunn
Sen. Murray
Sen. Poochigian
Sen. Sher
Sen. Speier
Sen. Vasconcellos
Sen. Vincent
 
Also much thanks to everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on 
this effort.  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, 
government, manufacturing, and real estate communities.
 
Here are the highlights of yesterday's actions:
 
1. For IOU's- No discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, 
2000 and June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.  If you have 
a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until  July 1 2001, to get it 
installed.  
2. DER installed within the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011.
3. The maximum capacity of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site.
4. The DER must have emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB 
established new guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early 
next year.
5. Customers with DER are still required to pay interconnection, public 
purpose charges, and obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources 
energy purchases program.
6. The CPUC shall require the electrical corporations to include non-utility 
owned DER in its planning process.
7. The CPUC is required to establish a firewall so that in the event that the 
implementation of DER results in net costs to the system, those costs stay 
within the customer class.
8. The CPUC shall require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that 
are non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the 
costs.
9. Muni's are required to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold 
public meetings to solicit comment for recommended changes.
Now we have momentum, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do on 
the Assembly side and with Governor's office.  We need the continued 
(increased) support of all of you as we move this forward.

Laura:
Sorry to bother you again, but I'm concerned that Justin is wildly busy and 
may not have the time to forward the package on to the SVMG.  I'm hoping that 
you might have the distribution list and might be able to forward to that 
list, too.  No big deal, just trying do everything we can to try to mobilize 
the troops on customer choice.

On interminable conference calls---on another right now.  Flight leaves at 
3:30 PM, which I think gets me there around 5 or 5:15 PM.  Why don't you just 
pick a restaurant and I'll meet you there.  I'm staying at 5th Avenue

me.  I'll call you when (and if) I get off this call.

Sagging Telecommunications Sector Leads Nasdaq Down 
By Johnathan Burns 
  
04/03/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The telecommunications sector led the Nasdaq Composite 
Index down Tuesday, as investors worrying about the earnings season and a 
slowdown in carrier spending hammered many stocks to new lows. 
The selloff of telecommunications carriers and equipment makers was 
widespread, with all of the big-name companies trading negatively. 
Shares of optical component maker JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) earlier hit a 
52-week low, recently trading down 11% to $14.88. Optical systems market 
leader Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) also hit a 52-week low, recently trading 
down 7% to $13. The day's biggest loser in the equipment space was optical 
systems maker Ciena Corp. (CIEN), which hit a new low and was recently 
trading down 16.5% to $35.50. 
The bloodshed was so widespread that a host of other equipment companies also 
hit new lows: Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) recently traded down 11% to $7.88 
while Corvis Corp. (CORV) was recently down 14.4% to $5.19. 
A rash of earnings warnings by software companies like Redback Networks Inc. 
(RBAK) and fiber optic equipment maker Harmonic Inc. (HLIT) after the bell 
Monday, coupled with continued funding concerns for start-up phone companies, 
served as a one-two punch for the sector. 
Start-up phone company Winstar Communications Inc. (WCII) recently traded 
down almost 54% to 41 cents, while peers Teligent Inc. (TGNT) dropped 31% to 
28 cents and XO Communications Inc. fell 38% to $3.22. Investors have become 
increasingly nervous that those companies will face bankruptcy, as the 
capital markets have dried up. 
Even well-funded carriers weren't exempt from Tuesday's selling pressure. 
Shares of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q) barely stayed above its 
52-week low of $32.13, recently dropping 6.2% to $33.50, while shares of AT&T 
Corp. (T) were off 5.1% to $20 and WorldCom Inc. (WCOM) fell 6.4% to $17.50.

The state submitted an amicus brief which we objected to. The hearing is the

come. 

Any news from the litigation front with UC/CSU?

I'll see you at 5:15 outside at the ticket counter level.  I'm taking Alaska.

I'll pick you up at 5:15 or so outside at the ticket counter level.  I need 
to put you in a cab for the ride back to the hotel--so I can get home around 
7:30.  I'll have a draft of the presentation ready for you to review.    

If things get screwed up, I'll call your cell phone voicemail and leave a 
message.  Below is the restaurant.  It's in SE, Portland.  A little different 
experience then eating downtown or in NW.  

The restaurant is essentially on the corner of Bybee and Milwaukie, in the 
Westmoreland area.

That's so weird.  Prentice left her car door ajar (when she went to go to 
school yesterday morning, it was dead and she had to get a jump).  

I was surprised that the phone was only 300 pesos.  I thought they'd charge 
by the minute, but apparently, it's a flat 10 pesos for local (i.e., 800 
calls), no matter how long one's one.

I left the car light on - battery totally dead!  Freezing cold in SF - no
coats - landed at 9 pm - home at 12:30 am.  ugh!!!  300 pesos is just the El
Cid part of the bill - I think the rest will be on your card.  Eldon
actually got them to adjust some of that off as well cuz he said your
connection kept going off.   I say "If only life always gave us credits when
our connections went off!"

we got back ok.  (i didn't know tulsa had such a neat airport.)

NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), parent 
of troubled utility Southern California Edison, said on Tuesday bankers are 
giving it and the utility more time to cure their defaults on three credit 
lines.

The announcement came after the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC), 
which sets rates, also on Tuesday voted to authorize the state's Department 
of Water Resources to sell between $12 billion and $14 billion of bonds to 
finance power purchases, and examine the financial links between the 
utilities and their parents.

The 30-day extension from Edison's banks means the banks will ``forbear,'' or 
not act upon, the credit line defaults.

``That will take us out to basically around April 14,'' said Ted Craver, 
chief financial officer of Edison International, during an investor 
conference call. The prior forbearance, the banks' second, had expired March 
13.

The California power crisis has led to periodic blackouts and left SoCal 
Edison, which owes more than $5.4 billion for post power costs, and the 
state's largest utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which owes about $8.9 
billion, on the brink of bankruptcy. A rate freeze imposed under the state's 
1996 utility deregulation law has prevented them from passing on their 
soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.

Though the PUC awarded the utilities a roughly 40 percent rate hike last 
week, allowing them to collect $4.8 billion more each year, analysts and the 
utilities said the hike effectively does nothing to let the utilities to 
recoup their prior costs.

``At best the utility is standing still (in that) it hasn't improved its cash 
flow or its cash position,'' said Craver. ``At worst, it is going backwards. 
That's our basic conclusion on the numbers and the mechanisms as we 
understand them.''

San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news), parent of Pacific G&E, has 
said it expects to take a $4.1 billion charge for unrecouped electricity 
costs, while Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison has said it may take a 
``substantial'' charge that may total as much as $2.7 billion.

The California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's 
power grid, early on Tuesday called another Stage Two emergency alert because 
of supply problems. Such alerts are declared when power reserves fall to 
within 5 percent of peak demand. The alert was later lifted.

Edison shares closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $12.82, up 27 
cents, or 2.2 percent. PG&E shares closed on the Big Board at $11.53, down 22 
cents, or 1.9 percent.

Craver also said in the conference call that SoCal Edison has rolled over 
364-day and 5-year Libor-based credit facilities that recently matured for a 
respective 30 and 90 days, and that Edison rolled over one of its own 
facilities for 45 days.

He concluded the call by expressing relief that creditors have not yet thrown 
the utility into bankruptcy, which analysts have said could already have 
happened by now had the PUC not granted the rate hike.

``I'm somewhat amazed about how disciplined everybody has been,'' he said. 
``We're seeking protection from misguided regulatory decisions, and the 
solution is really in that same venue, in the regulatory and political and 
legislative context.'' 

Can't thank you enough for your help and for comments.  I'm going to continue 
to work on it.  Have another data question.  Can we determine big high tech's 
electricity bill was in California and nationally last year?  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,  Great  organization  and  great  stuff here... Three  comments  on  
the   message  you  have  prepared. 

 All  US   Hi  tech is   8 percent of  the US   GNP-- not just   
California's  hi  tech  share... ( which  I think  is how  it  now  
reads.....)

I would  add under " Last Century Infrastructure "    that  Calif. only  
added    670 MW  in the past  5 years  when it  needed
5500 MW--  it  needed   8   times  more  than  was  actually  built  but 
could not  get  built  due to   siting   restrictions...

On last  Slide   last  line  Small  typo     reads "  a....a...." 

Great job..   Margaret..

Some data on Coke and Quaker.  More to follow.

May be of interest to your biz dev efforts.

Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms 

(Published April 4, 2001) 
There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that 
envelops California's energy crisis. 
Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control 
and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer 
blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's 
utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are 
scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals 
for blame. 
No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very 
apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with 
energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the 
hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special 
committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis 
have gone into semihibernation. 
Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears 
that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will 
backfire. "Just remember Jimmy Carter," state Controller Kathleen Connell 
warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have "no excuses" for 
perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. "We will be 
accountable on Election Day 2002," she said. 
Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a 
second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined 
sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his 
actions, saying, "I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this 
problem," and trying to pin blame on Republicans. 
Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape 
from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses 
in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of 
mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill 
Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis 
Davis. 
The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every 
sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled 
"Meeting the Energy Challenge" to defend the governor's actions, it's 
apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. 
The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power 
purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into 
a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The 
long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases 
have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for 
them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. 
Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase 
market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a 
deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. 
Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the 
state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall 
Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power 
generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission 
grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. 
The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the 
specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air 
conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. 
Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With 
Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to 
protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Market Participants,

Attached is the California ISO's revised third RFB for Loads with
emergency back-up generators that wish to participate in the ISO Demand
Relief Program (DRP).  The ISO would especially like to thank the
participants that submitted bids that included back-up generators into the
first DRP RFB and encourages those participants to submit bids for this
revised RFB.

As mentioned in the March 30 Market Notice for the second DRP RFB (for
Loads not using back-up generators), the design of the back-up generator
program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first DRP RFB.
Loads using back-up generators will still be dispatched after the DRP Load
blocks but will be available for 24 hours per month, similar to the Load
portion.  Successful bidders will start in the program either June 1 or
July 1 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized.

Bids are due to the ISO on May 1 in accordance with the attached RFB.

This RFB will also be posted on the ISO Home Page (www.caiso.com) in the
next 24 hours.

Yo, people.  I love sports.  Love baseball.  Love you.  But I ain't 
necessarily THAT keen on tying up my Sunday evenings, since, with no school 
this summer, I plan on spending just about every Sunday night driving back 
late from Mendocino, where I'll be working on putting vines in, sporting 
around in that new Zodiac, and shit like that.  And when I ain't there, I 
hope to be backpacking, endurance riding etc.

But y'all should go ahead without me.

Dear Poolsters,

I just want you all to know that I, Cameron's boyfriend, the guy who is 
behind Cameron's picks (save when we came in #1 last week, when I was out of 
town, and Cameron did the picks -- an accomplishment slightly embarrassing, 
but wonderful all the same) and the same guy who moved to San Francisco for 
Cameron (or for our relationship), and, upon my arrival, pledged my loyalty 
-- in front of the whole Sellers' family, hand on Bible -- to the 49ers (it 
was easier when Steve Young retired, for Cameron told me that he was the 
only man she would ever leave me for... Gosh I love Jeff Garcia!)... Yes 
this same guy was begging for Cameron to take the 49ers against Dallas. 
Begging. Entrapped by the hubris of winning last week, she refused my 
advise. So, we ended up in 3rd. Oh well. Things could be worse. I just 
wonder, maybe this is the sign of a true fan, someone who refuses to pick 
the 49ers for fear that the heart's involved... Nah, I'll still pick 'em, 
even if I have to beg. Good luck to all, and go 49ers!

Energy Firms' Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry 

Deregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being 
misleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also 
predicting bigger profits for investors. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers 

In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California's 
power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of 
speeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc. 
executive, would ensure "maximum customer savings" and "low-cost power." 
That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall 
Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost 
revenue and stock value. "We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes 
across the gas and power market," Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson 
declared in a publication targeting large investors. "The energy 
marketplace," he predicted, "will simply get more volatile." 
Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and 
public records shows. In the years since California's pioneering deregulation 
plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending 
similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers.
Now, those divergent messages--electricity prices will fall but corporate 
revenue and profits will climb--will be a key focus of a special state Senate 
committee charged with investigating the alleged manipulation in the power 
market.
"How you can tell your investors you're about to make a whole ton of money in 
the very short term, and tell the consumers of California you're about to get 
lower rates?" said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), a former consumer attorney 
who is heading the legislative probe. 
Investigations by the state attorney general and federal regulators are 
continuing, but remain largely secret.
The Senate panel could offer the most open and wide-ranging examination yet 
of alleged misconduct among power sellers. The bipartisan panel expects to 
begin requesting documents from power producers as early as today and begin 
hearings in a few weeks. Committee members stress that they are hoping the 
power companies will cooperate but are ready to issue subpoenas if necessary.

Suppliers Deny Misleading Public
The legislative probe comes as many state officials are moving aggressively 
to expose alleged market manipulation and overcharges totaling billions of 
dollars by the power suppliers.
"Somewhere along the line, there may be a skunk in the woodpile. And if there 
is, we need to find out about it," said K. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), 
the committee's ranking Republican.
Another panel member, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), noted that all 
companies try to maximize profits. "But [we want] to understand how the 
market was manipulated and how sellers took advantage of the market."
The power traders strongly deny acting improperly or sending misleading 
signals to the public.
"Hogwash," said Tom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy. 
Spokesmen for Dynegy said there was nothing inconsistent in the statements of 
their executives.
The companies maintain that California's problems stem from soaring 
electricity demand, lagging power plant construction and a faulty 
deregulation plan adopted by the Legislature in 1996. "You have a flawed 
structure there," said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa.
Sousa and executives of other power suppliers say their comments to the 
general public and to Wall Street are not contradictory because unfettered 
competition--not the California model--would have created opportunities to 
both make money and cut rates.
Still, regulators, lawmakers and ratepayer groups note that only half the 
promises made by the power dealers have been realized so far--their earnings 
and stock prices have risen at record rates as electricity prices have soared.
"The big lie was, while they were telling ratepayers to 'Trust us, we're 
going to lower your rates,' they were planning the entire time to raise the 
rates," said San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor 
who specialized in fraud cases. Aguirre is representing state ratepayers in a 
class-action lawsuit against the power companies.
Just last month, California's independent grid operator reported that many 
power sellers "used well-planned strategies to ensure maximum possible 
prices." Potential overcharges could total nearly $6.3 billion. 
The Senate panel wants to track information that Dynegy and other generators 
were providing to the investment community in the 1990s as a possible way of 
determining whether they entered the California market with plans to run up 
electricity costs. Among many other things, the committee plans to seek 
internal projections of how the firms expected wholesale prices and profits 
to rise under deregulation. 
Members also want to know how the suppliers expected to recoup billions in 
outlays for California power plants being unloaded by regulated utilities. 
Some of the purchases were far above book value, stunning analysts.
"What did they know that the rest of us didn't at the time they were 
purchasing those generations facilities?" asked Dunn. "They knew something."
One thing the power wholesalers say they did know was that tight power 
supplies in California would probably boost prices, at least for a time.
"They were going anywhere where they thought energy [use] would spike 
upward," recalled market analyst Joan Goodman, who was familiar with company 
pitches. "California was one of those places because it didn't have 
sufficient [power] plants."
Duke Energy projected that prices would rise after 2000, although the company 
says it did not foresee the huge increases that occurred, according to 
spokesman Williams.
However, when the company sealed one of the first packages of power plant 
purchases in the state in 1997, Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory said 
in a press release it would "deliver greater value" to California customers.
The publicity spin was similar when Edison's sprawling beachfront power plant 
in El Segundo changed hands the following year. "Consumers in California will 
begin to benefit from more competitively priced electricity and more vibrant 
economy," announced Craig Mataczynski, vice president of Minneapolis-based 
NRG Corp., a partner in the purchase with Dynegy.

Big Growth Was Predicted
Utilities reaping profits from plant sales also trumpeted the consumer 
windfall theme. Electricity rates would drop 20% by 2001, Pacific Gas & 
Electric's top executive, Robert Glynn, said in early 1998. "There is no 
product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable downward price 
trajectory into the future."
But to its Wall Street audience, the power suppliers emphasized climbing 
revenues.
Atlanta-based Southern Co., now Mirant, told investors in 1999 that its plan 
to buy plants and market power had brought the company to the "doorstep of 
significant growth opportunities."
"We believe our strategies will result in the best shareholder return 
available," Bill Dahlberg, then-chief executive officer, said shortly after 
buying three California plants.
Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said assurances given the public and 
assumptions directed to Wall Street were "just a different way of delivering 
the same message." The firm was saying it would be "reliable to shareholders 
and reliable to consumers."
Now, with rolling blackouts and record electricity bill increases, federal 
and state authorities are alleging that large energy suppliers played the 
power market too hard.
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it found evidence 
of $124 million in "unjust and unreasonable" charges during the severest 
periods of electricity shortage. The commission, often criticized for being 
too lenient on private power companies, ordered the firms to refund the money 
or further justify the charges.
Some firms are contesting the findings, saying the prices they charged were 
justified. 
Investigators and regulators have faced a vexing challenge trying to unravel 
the complex financial workings of the large power traders. The companies 
closely guard information, and some recently refused to comply with subpoenas 
from the state Public Utilities Commission, which is also probing the power 
market.
Whether the Senate investigating committee will have the resources and 
tenacity to get much further remains to be seen. But Democrats and 
Republicans alike insist they are serious about untangling how the power 
market went haywire.
"I haven't seen that much smoke where there hasn't been a fire," Dunn said.

You might be right.  Apologies if that's what happened.

where are the charges? and please divide it all equally.  it was a great time

I need to check more, but here's my take.  Politically---very popular with 
legislators; very easy to pass, etc.  However, it would be so complicated to 
implement and is very likely in conflict with so many federal laws, that I 
think they'll have an extremely difficult time pulling it off.  In addition, 
the utilities (whose retained generation collected a big portion of the 
"windfall" selling through the PX) would be subject to a big tax hit.  Would 
that push them into bankruptcy?  In short, easy to pass politically, pretty 
difficult to make stick legally.  This help?  

You still have your PCG position?

Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product
2001-04-04 17:19 (New York)

   By Christina Cheddar
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise,
knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more
important.
  For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping
track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became even
more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based
commodities trading network.
  In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on
EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders
manage the credit risk.
  Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited
basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the
company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format.
  Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known 
as
the "Enron cost of credit." The rating is expressed as an interest rate.
  The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy
and other related information.
  While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has
turned the product into a new revenue stream.
  Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for 
a
fee.
  The site also can sell a user a "digital bankruptcy swap," which is a way to
hedge against credit exposure.
  The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a
company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against.
  For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable
to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately.
  According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit
is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity.
  The tool is important because "in just a short amount of time, a company's
credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight."
  At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into
their earnings models. However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in
mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could
increase.

Ken Lay put a call in today to Scott McNealy.  His office called back to find 
out what specific bill included direct access.  When I called back, they put 
me in touch with Mavis Toscano, who's in Sun Microsystems' state and local 
government affairs office.  She's Scott's point person on public policy, and 
she's been working on the energy issue.  Mavis had done some checking and no 
one had heard anything about direct access.

Sun is active in three main trade associations: the Chamber, the American 
Electronics Association (AEA) and Technet.  None of those organizations said 
their members were asking for direct access, but Mavis promised to put calls 
in to them and get direct access on the radar screen.  Although she said 
they're not inclined to send letters, Mavis said she'd make some calls into 
the legislators, specifically Bowen.

Can you define "off line?"  You mean they're going to "island' themselves, no 
longer taking power from the grid? To get the standby service, they'll need 
to sign an agreement under PG&E's standby tariffs (the tariff for cogens if 
the cogens getting the standby, or for the University, if UC's taking the 
standby).

Calif Gov To Make 'Important' Energy Announcement Thurs  ????
Updated: Wednesday, April 4, 2001 08:17 AM?ET ????

(This article was originally published Wednesday) 

By Jason Leopold 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--In a highly unusual move, California Gov. Gray Davis 
Tuesday requested radio and television stations in the state to clear five 
minutes of time Thursday evening so he can make an important announcement 
regarding the state's energy crisis. 

Davis is expected to deliver a speech at 6:05 p.m. PST and will likely talk 
about the state's conservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt shortfall expected 
next month, the need to bring new generation online, recent rate hikes 
ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission, and the possibility 
for further rate increases this summer to keep the state's three 
investor-owned utilities solvent, sources close to Davis told Dow Jones 
Newswires. 

The source said Davis is not expected to discuss a final agreement to buy the 
power lines owned by PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs), unit Pacific Gas & 
Electric, Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) unit, Southern California 
Edison, and Sempra Energy's (SRE, news, msgs) unit, San Diego Gas & Electric. 

Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, would not comment on Davis' speech. 

In a memo to the media, Davis' office said the governor will "deliver an 
important live address on energy from his office in Sacramento. During this 
historic address to the people of California, the governor will speak in 
detail about California's energy emergency and make an important 
announcement." 

The last time a California governor interrupted a broadcast schedules was in 
1992, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson delivered a speech about the state's 
budget problems, a spokesman in Davis' office said. 

But Davis' staff said "this is the first time in recent memory that a 
Governor has asked for time statewide to deliver a live address to the people 
of California."

Calif Gov Staff To Speak To Analysts About Energy Crisis ?? ??
Updated: Wednesday, April 4, 2001 05:37 PM?ET ???

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Gov. Gray Davis' advisers will speak to 
Wall Street analysts Thursday following a live state address on the state's 
energy crisis, according to an email sent to the financial community and 
obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. 

Daivs' staff, in a highly unusual move, asked radio and television 
broadcasters to clear five minutes of air time Thursday night so Davis can 
make an "important announcement" about the state's months-long energy crisis. 

Sources close to the governor said Davis will discuss the state's 
conservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt supply shortfall expected this summer, 
recent rate increases ordered by state regulators and the possibility for 
further rate increases to replenish the state's budget surplus. 

Davis is expected to discuss plans for keeping the state's three 
investor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & 
Electric, Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California 
Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, 
solvent but he isn't expected to discuss a proposal to buy the utilities' 
power lines. 

Davis spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said he couldn't comment on the governor's 
speech. He said, however, Davis has received the financial data regarding the 
state's spending on wholesale electricity and what it expects to spend in the 
months ahead. 

In the email sent to Wall Street analysts, Davis' top financial adviser, Joe 
Fichera, said the governor's advisers will hold a conference call at 9:45 
p.m. EDT (0145 GMT) with analysts followed by a question-and-answer session. 

Regarding Davis' speech Thursday, Fichera wrote in his email that "while 
everyone will wish to speculate on what (Davis) will or will not say, I can 
point out that the governor has been consistent in his goals to achieve: 
significant demand side management, increased generation supply and 
restoration of the financial health of the investor-owned utilities. 

"All three components are important elements to resolving the energy 
situation in California and will be addressed by the governor," Fichera wrote 
in the email. 

In addition, "it may go without saying, but the situation in California 
involves many moving parts, many constituencies and independent players that 
need to be brought together to resolve a problem that is of a size and scope 
that no one anticipated," Fichera's email says. 

"It certainly appears confusing and chaotic. The governor and his team 
recognize the complexity of the problem and are rigorously attempting to move 
the process to closure," the email says. "He is addressing all open issues so 
that consumers, investors and others can achieve some certainty and move on. 
We cannot make all the moving parts stop, nevertheless, the governor will 
provide the leadership needed for a resolution."

I would bet that our investor relations either have it, or can get from one 
of their analyst buddies.  You want to check on that?

Based on latest info hear's latest assessment of Gov's talk:

I'm in charge.
Here's all the wonderful things I've done thus far to address the crisis 
(likely to include Edison TX talks, since it seems he has no choice but to 
continue that charade).
It's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get 
through it.
Rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are, and they will 
be painful---must be part of the solution; and future increases may well be 
likely.
Blame FERC and the generators, because it's their fault.
Windfall profits is a good idea.

Kari Dohn of the Gov's office  and I have been trading voicemails.  She's 
going to LA with Governor Backbone later this afternoon for the speech.  If 
she and I hook up, I'll report back on what, if anything, I hear.

proposed by lawmakers on electric generators that have made a fortune
selling power to California this year. 

He also broke with his appointees on the Public Utilities Commission in
saying private companies and other large users should be allowed to contract
directly for power with generators. 

. . . . 

For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their
power from generators instead of going through the utilities. 

A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly
bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts. 

"That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power
and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid," Davis said. "But
our problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the
grid, we should encourage, not discourage that." 

The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors for
more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized
his handling of the energy crisis. 

"I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve
this challenge," Davis said. "There were a lot of suggestions in there I'm
willing to adopt." 

. . . . 

Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute
address at 6:05 p.m. Thursday that he has asked California television
stations to carry live. 

However, he said he will "share with them (viewers) the progress that we've
made and what we have to get through." 

He is expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases
approved last week by the PUC for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
and Southern California Edition Co.

BODY:

???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about
California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch
would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.

??Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he
planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get
through.''

??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent
rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for
customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
and
Southern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations to
carry his remarks live.

??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies
blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.

??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson
Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter 
state
budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency 
power.
The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also 
threaten
to scare away new businesses, the report said.

??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy
prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits
tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to 
California
this year.

??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It
would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing
power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold 
it
at much higher rates.

??''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap
enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This 
profiteering
must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.

??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected
industry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generators
from building new power plants in California.

??''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can 
to
increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.
Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said.

??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that 
manner,
''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only things
companies understand is leverage.''

??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their
power from generators instead of going through the utilities.

??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. They
argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with
generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state
has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped
utilities.

HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning

??LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California 
gathered
Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's 
energy
crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch 
spoke,
the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.

??"I don't have any control over this," the beleaguered technician operating
the sound system called out after repeated outages.

??"I feel your pain," Lynch replied with a smile.

??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackouts
that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the
commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from
consumer groups.

??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. She
promised to lead "a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out 
of
the California economy and not adding a whit of value."

??Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended
by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that.

??Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had
enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate 
hike.

??Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by
the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the
small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.

??Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a "failed experiment"
and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that "true deregulation is
our goal." The problem was that "the state stepped back too much" from
management of the power system and that there had been "too much ideology and
theory and not enough practical solutions," she added.

??A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. "We are expecting severe
difficulties for this summer and next summer," said Barry Sedlik, a Southern
California Edison manager.

??Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the
electricity problems are spreading. "This may go on for a while and it's not
just California," he said. "In the near term we've got chaos," he added.

??But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers 
may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling 
blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President 
Bush's brother is governor.

??Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage,
could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in
an interview.

easy, babe.

Corbett Introduces Windfall Profits Tax Measure

SACRAMENTO =01) Responding to increasing electricity rates and the
continuing threat of rolling blackouts, Assembly Revenue and Taxation
Committee Chair Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro) today introduced a
windfall profits tax measure intended to help restore sanity to the
pricing of electricity in California.  The bill, AB 128X, imposes an
electrical power generation windfall profits tax on the windfall profits
realized by power generators, their affiliates, and the middlemen who
participate in California's energy market. However, in recognition of
the fact that some generators are cooperatively working with the state
by holding their costs down, the measure is targeted at generators whose
gross receipts significantly exceed the cost these entities incur to
produce the energy they sell.

"We cannot continue to pay the exorbitant rates that are currently being
charged in today's marketplace.  Consumers and small businesses are
seeing their energy rates skyrocket.  The state is spending $45 million
per day to help meet demand.  We are looking toward a summer of rolling
blackouts.  Yet, we continue to allow some electricity generators and
middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into
the state.  This profiteering must stop, and AB 128X will help us ensure
that it does."

The windfall profits tax measure imposes an add-on tax equal to a set
percentage of the gross receipts derived from the sale of electrical
power into the state. The measure also targets middlemen who have been
able to game the electricity market by buying up supply and reselling it
at much higher rates.  AB 128X hits these middlemen by taxing the
receipts they realize from excessively high markups.

"As Chair of a working group charged with developing a windfall profits
tax, I look forward to working with my colleagues on moving this measure
through the Legislature."

Thank god.

UCLA FORECASTERS SEE NATIONAL RECESSION AS INEVITABLE IN 2001; CALIFORNIA 
WILL NOT BE IMMUNE, WITH BAY AREA VERY SUSCEPTIBLE

? 
LOS ANGELES --Economists with the UCLA Anderson Business Forecast see even 
more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in 2001 and project a 90 
percent chance that the nation's longest economic expansion will come to an 
end no later than the first quarter of 2002. 
"The year 2001 is a transition year that will take the U.S. economy from the 
Internet Rush of 1996-2000 to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in 
2002," said Edward Leamer, UCLA Anderson Business Forecast director and 
Anderson School professor. However, getting from here to there will involve 
some painful adjustments, he warns, and "monetary medicine" from the Fed 
won't stop the pain this time.
According to the econometric model used by UCLA's forecasters, the 
probability of a 2001 recession has increased nearly 30 percent since 
December 2000. Just three months ago, Dr. Leamer's forewarning of a recession 
was the most pessimistic -- and, as it turns out, the most accurate forecast 
made that quarter. 
"The expansion of 1999-2000 was driven by 'New Economy' investment 
opportunities. Firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block to 
have a cool website. Fear was a big motivator. Internet firms feared losing 
first-mover advantage. Bricks-and-mortar firms feared they would lose out to 
pure Internet business models. Almost every enterprise in the U.S. invested 
heavily in IT equipment and software, and hired the associated personnel," 
said Dr. Leamer. "Things are different now." 
The national recession and slowdown in investment in information technology 
and software has different implications for the principal regions of 
California. A recession is quite likely for the Bay Area, while Southern 
California will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outright 
recession. 
Dr. Tom Lieser, author of the California Forecast, expects to see a 
"high-tech" recession in California that will have a disproportionate impact 
on the San Francisco Bay Area. "We will most likely see not only a slowing of 
demand for electronics, communications equipment and related products, but 
also a weeding out of the less well-capitalized firms in these industries," 
said Dr. Lieser. 
The UCLA economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through 2002, 
with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates. A substantial slowdown in 
the California service sector -- a mainstay of the state's economic growth -- 
is also quite likely. 
"The strong increase in residential building permits seen during the 
November-January period will likely be short-lived," said Dr. Lieser. "We 
expect to see declining home prices in the Bay Area this year. Southern 
California will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of price 
increases." 
Higher energy prices, the economists argue, may pose a greater problem for 
other states than for California, because of the state's lower per capita 
consumption. On a per capita basis, California ranked 49th out of 50 in 
electricity consumption and 26th in natural gas consumption, both in 1999. 
Even with the state's notorious dependence on the automobile, it still ranks 
only 15th out of the 47 reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption. 
And while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affect 
California incomes and employment in the short term, a prolonged electricity 
crisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run.
The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast is the most widely followed and 
often-cited forecast for the state of California, and was unique in 
predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and 
Southern California, and the strength of the state economy's rebound since 
1993. 
The Forecast was presented at an all-day conference at Korn Convocation Hall 
at The Anderson School at UCLA. In addition to providing the outlook for the 
state and national economy, the conference examined the economic impact of 
California's energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of the 
nation's most prominent authorities. Speakers included Loretta Lynch, 
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Mark Bernstein, 
senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation, Barry Sedlik, manager, economic 
and business development, Southern California Edison, and Joseph M. Otting, 
executive vice president, Union Bank of California. 

FYI:  The State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced that the melded interest 
rate on the bonds that he intends to issue (mix of taxable and tax-exempt) 
will be 5.38%.

Poll thus far:
Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file.  He made the decision after 
talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing 
that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would 
pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say "poor quality 
receivables"?).  Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work 
shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase.
Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't 
know what the position of his members is.
Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to 
direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports 
direct access.

Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going 
to say.  Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we 
remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, 
e.g., equity, no cross subsidies.  

Thoughts?

I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne.

Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power 
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001) 
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a 
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order 
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state 
without guarantee of payment. 
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but 
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant 
off-line for maintenance. 
On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California 
landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction 
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. 
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found 
that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat." 
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a high 
likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal. 
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the 
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel 
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in 
July. 
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least 
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which 
maintains and controls power transmissions. 
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any 
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. 
"It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change 
anything over the weekend," said Detmers. "But if Reliant decided on a 
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely 
could have a system emergency." 
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but 
declined to specify their next move. 
"Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company 
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate." 
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District 
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., 
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and 
production of electricity. 
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of 
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales 
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, 
and that goes directly to an appellate court. 
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two 
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though 
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly 
in debt. 
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay 
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to 
the utilities. 
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston 
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & 
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue 
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to 
sell to companies that are not creditworthy. 
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can 
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice. 
"My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson. He added, however, 
that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don't have a tool to 
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do" -- respond to 
emergency demands for power. 
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no 
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators 
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must 
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. 
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special 
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. 
"Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court 
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he 
said. "But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short 
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at 
risk." 
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for 
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend 
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its 
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has 
jurisdiction. 
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. 
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for 
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big 
utilities and sell its power on the open market. 
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants 
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in 
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell 
its power to PG&E. 
The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative 
energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell 
their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state. 

Thanks.  Where'd you hear and do you have any more info?

Jeff

Jeff & Mona:  We have confirmed that our contracts are silent on the issue.  
Question remains as to what the language of the original decision was...Can 
you suggest someone who can dig into this for us?  Should I just phone Mike 
Day?  Let me know...MLC

Likely needs to be a legal analysis based on the language of the original 
decision etablishing the credits.  But seems to me that we have a deal with 
our customers to receive service according to price, terms and conditions 
stated in our contracts with those customers, and that the contract language 
would govern how the credit is treated.  If  the contracts don't speak to the 
issue of credits, seems that our contract agrees to provide rez customers 
with service for a a certain price, and as such, it would be up to us whether 
we flow it through.  But a lawyer, I am not.  Are our contracts silent on the 
issue?

Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:

Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
Credits.

Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
(per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?

Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?

Who could handle this issue for Diane?

*PG&E <PCG.N> SAYS PACIFIC G&E FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 VOLUNTARY
BANKRUPTCY RELIEF

NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is 
California's largest investor-owned utility and has been struggling with that 
state's power crisis, said on Friday it filed a voluntary petition for 
bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern 
District of California. 

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the 
filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents. 

The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 

The utility said in the filing that it "retains control of its assets and is 
authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court." 

A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail 
prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back 
debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale 
power costs to consumers.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company Files for Chapter 11 Reorganization

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001--Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company, the utility unit of PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG), today filed for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in San Francisco 
bankruptcy court. The company said it is taking this action in light of its 
unreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than $300 million 
per month, continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the 
company, and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray 
Davis and his representatives are going nowhere.

Neither PG&E Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries, including its 
National Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization or are 
affected by the utility's filing.

"We chose to file for Chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively because we 
expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution, which 
thus far the State and the State's regulators have been unable to achieve," 
said Robert D. Glynn, Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. "The 
regulatory and political processes have failed us, and now we are turning to 
the court."

Glynn added, "Our objective is to move through the Chapter 11 reorganization 
process as quickly as possible, without disruption to our operations or 
inconvenience to our customers. Throughout this crisis, our 20,000 employees 
have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the 
13 million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and 
electricity."

Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of 
Chapter 11 primarily due to:

   --  Failure by the state to assume the full procurement
       responsibility for Pacific Gas and Electric's "net open
       position" as was provided under AB1X. This has the result of
       increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy
       procurement costs, which the utility estimates to be
       approximately $300 million or more per month.

   --  The impact of actions by the California Public Utilities
       Commission (CPUC) on March 27, 2001, and April 3, 2001, that
       created new payment obligations for the company and undermined
       its ability to return to financial viability.

   --  Lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide
       recovery of $9 billion in wholesale power purchases made by
       the utility since June 2000, which have not been recoverable
       in frozen rates.

   --  The adoption by the CPUC of an illegal and retroactive
       accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true
       uncollected wholesale costs.

"In addition, despite Pacific Gas & Electric's best efforts to work with the 
State of California to reach a consensual, responsible, fair and 
comprehensive solution to California's energy crisis, no agreement has been 
reached with the Governor and the Governor's representatives have 
dramatically slowed the pace and the progress of discussions over the past 
month.

"Furthermore since last fall, we have filed comprehensive plans for resolving 
this matter with the CPUC, but they have not acted affirmatively on them," 
said Glynn.

On October 4, 2000, Pacific Gas and Electric sought emergency rate action by 
the CPUC. In November 2000, we filed our rate stabilization plan, which, if 
adopted, would have increased electric prices by an initial 25 percent, 
compared with the 46 percent recently adopted by the CPUC. Neither request 
was acted upon. Had the state acted at that time:

-- Pacific Gas and Electric would have been kept creditworthy;

   --  Pacific Gas and Electric would have been able to enter into
       long-term power purchase contracts at prices lower than those
       announced by the state;

   --  The state would not have had to almost exhaust the state's
       budget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase
       power for the utility's customers;

   --  The state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in
       bonds to cover these power purchases; and

   --  The state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend
       billions of dollars to purchase the state's three
       investor-owned utility's electric transmission systems.

"This year, the state has spent more than $3 billion on power purchases and, 
with the CPUC, has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses," noted 
Glynn. "In contrast, since June Pacific Gas and Electric Company has spent $9 
billion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and 
exhausted its ability to continue borrowing, but there has been no progress 
on a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as provided by law.

"Statements by the Governor and other public officials since last September 
gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached outside the 
context of Chapter 11 that would restore the utility's financial viability 
and enable it to meet its financial obligations equitably. However, these 
statements have not been followed up by constructive actions, and a 
reorganization in Chapter 11 is now the most feasible means of resolution."

The utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating its 
business during bankruptcy, including paying vendors and suppliers in full 
for goods and services received after the filing. The utility will pay 
electric commodity suppliers as provided by law. The utility intends to 
continue normal electric and gas transmission and distribution functions 
during the Chapter 11 process. Employees will continue to be paid. Health 
care plans and other benefits for employees and most retirees will continue. 
The utility's qualified retirement plans for retirees and vested employees 
are fully funded and protected by federal law.

SCE Responds to PG&E Bankruptcy Filing

Southern California Edison Company (SCE) released the following statement in 
response to the decision today by Pacific Gas and Electric to file for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This statement
is by Edison International Chairman, President, and CEO John Bryson. 

ROSEMEAD, Calif., April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- This is a sad day for California. 
PG&E has had a proud history of service to our state for more than a century.

We at Southern California Edison continue to believe that working out a 
comprehensive solution to our current crisis is a preferable course to take. 
PG&E's decision today does not change our position. 
Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International (NYSE: EIX) is a premier 
international electric power generator, distributor and structured finance

FYI, I've faxed PG&E's filing to Rick Shapiro.  If others don't have it and 
want it, let me know and I'll fax it.  The filing's brief--about 10 
pages--with more detail apparently to be filed.  It lists the top 20 
creditors.  The only ENE listing in the filing is ENE Canada at $28M.  

The other thing that Governor and his PUC could have done many months ago was 
realign rates to more accurately reflect the real cost of power.  That 
arguably was a key determinant driving PG&E to Bankruptcy.

I have returned a call to Gary Gentile from the AP.  I gave him this 
statement and refused further comments on other issues, which included 1) 
"what is Enron's actual exposure?", 2) "what was Enron's opinion of Gov. 
Davis' speech last night?", and 3) "was this PG&E's only option?"  I did 
respond to one follow-up question, which was "what options were available 
months ago?"  My answer included the following 1) demand side solutions, 2) 
allowing long-term contracting for power supplies, and 3) expediting the 
siting process for new supplies.

It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the 
courts for a resolution.  Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been 
available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis 
and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive 
action. 

Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on 
our financial condition.

If pressed:  Any further comment would be speculative, as we have not yet 
seen the filing.

deadline is monday for the story.

Jeff --

Currently, having signed the confidentiality agreement in Phase II of the
GRC, I am receiving, about every two weeks, a CD with an updated ,
confidential version of their integrated rate model. I now have a collection
of about 20 of theses things.  The decision was made last February to have
me (as opposed to anyone at Enron) sign the confidentiality agreement and
receive the model while we decided what we were going to do in the
proceeding.  Now that we decided that we are not going to do anything, I was
considering contacting the appropriate PG&E attorney and getting my name
removed from the list to receive model updates and returning the ones I have
gotten to date. I wanted to make sure this was okay with you before I
proceeded.

Great.  Thanks.

Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.

04/06/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday 
it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its 
broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously 
described as an internal redeployment of staff. 
Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is 
cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has 
completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network 
and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal 
computers.
"The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are 
required for technical positions," she said. 
The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active 
role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate 
events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than 
expected, she said. 
However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue 
entertainment-on-demand services actively. 
Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for 
redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron 
units, although there could be some involuntary terminations. 
Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron 
Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of 
staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment 
there. 
The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading 
in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in 
line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and 
telecommunications stocks in particular. On Friday it was up 95 cents at 
$56.65. 
Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband 
communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth 
marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and 
electricity trading operation. 
Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's 
success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and 
other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last 
year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. 
Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform 
strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, 
exceeding the total for all of 2000. 
Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to 
fill some other positions.

This thing's been floating around the web for a while.  Show's what's wrong 
with good ol' California.  To wit:

We want federal water subsidies so we can kill the fish and grow rice and 
grapefruit in the desert ("and we'll keep it all for us?"). 
Let's drive our freakin' gas-guzzlin' SUVs all over, but hey, who needs to 
invest in roads; and somebody else come quick and clean up our air from all 
those emissions.  
And we're 49th in the nation for spending on education.  Great stuff.  
Now, we've decided we want other state's with less sophisticated people (in 
places like Nevada, Montana, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico) to build power 
plants (and pollution) in their states to feed electricity, and dam their 
rivers and kill their salmon so that we can heat our hot tubs and STILL pay 3 
cents a kilowatt hour.  
And oh, by the way, it's federal taxes and the military industrial complex 
which has funded CA's weapons industry and communications industry.  As no 
big fan of the military industrial comples, I'm just crying crocodile tears.  

Generally the kind of self-righteous doo-doo that turns people off to what is 
an otherwise great place to be.

Yours in tender diatribes,
Jeff

PS Scott, I think that you're absolutely right:  drilling in the Arctic 
Refuge in good for America....

Hope this doesn't piss Jeff off too much...

America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because California
doesn't have enough electricity to meet its needs. The rest of the
country (including George W. Bush's energy secretary Spencer Abraham,
who wants Californians to suffer through blackouts as justification for
drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) seems to
be just fine with letting Californians dangle in the breeze without
enough power to meet their needs. They laugh at Californians'
frivolity.

Well, everybody. Here's how it really is: California ranks 48th in the 
nation in power consumed per person. California grows more than half the 
nation's fruit, nuts and vegetables. We're keeping them. We need something 
to eat when the power goes out. We grow 99 percent or more of the nation's 
almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, kiwi fruit, olives, persimmons, 
pistachios, prunes, raisins and walnuts. Hope you won't miss them.

California is the nation's number one dairy state. We're keeping our
dairy products. We'll need plenty of fresh ones since our refrigerators
can't be relied upon. Got milk?

We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in state.
Silicon Valley is ours, after all. Without enough electricity, which
you're apparently keeping for yourselves, we just plain don't have
enough software to spare.

We're keeping all our airplanes. California builds a good percentage of
the commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you want
to go. When yours wear out, you'd better hope Boeing's Washington plant
can keep you supplied. There isn't enough electricity here to allow us
to export any more planes than we need ourselves.

And while we're at it, we're keeping all our high-tech aerospace stuff,
too, like the sophisticated weapons systems that let you sleep at
night, not worried you might wake up under the rule of some foreign
kook. [As opposed to some domestic kook]

Oh, yeah, and if you want to make a long-distance call, remember where
the satellite components and tracking systems come from. Maybe you
could get back in the habit of writing letters.

Want to see a blockbuster movie this weekend? Come to California. We
make them here. Since we'll now have to make them with our own
electricity, we're keeping them. Even if we shot them somewhere else,
the labs, printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound facilities
are all here.

Want some nice domestic wine? We produce over 17 million gallons per
year. We'll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we think about the
fact that no matter how many California products we export to make the
rest of America's lives better, America can't see its way clear to help
us out with a little electricity. You can no longer have any of our
wine.

You all complain that we don't build enough power plants. Well, you
don't grow enough food, write enough software, make enough movies,
build enough airplanes and defense systems or make enough wine.

This is your last warning, America. Lighten (us) up before it's too late.

Love,

The Californians

IBEW Statement on PG&E Bankruptcy

PR Newswire
04/06/01, 5:02p
(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)

WASHINGTON, April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to the bankruptcy 
announcement made by Pacific Gas and Electric, Edwin D. Hill, International 
President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), 
issued the following statement. 

"Pacific Gas and Electric's filing for bankruptcy could make a dire situation 
in California even worse. On behalf of the 13,500 IBEW Local Union 1245 
members employed by PG&E and the public they serve, we believe it is 
imperative that constructive action be taken now.

"Specifically, we call on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to 
stop dragging its feet and impose price controls on the wholesale electricity 
market in California. It is obvious that price gouging by wholesale suppliers 
has bled dry the investor-owned utilities and precipitated this crisis. The 
state has purchased power in an effort to prop up the system, but it too has 
paid the same inflated prices. This only threatens California's budget 
surplus and places an unfair burden on taxpayers while doing nothing to 
address the root of the problem.

"We also believe that it is time for government and industry to work together 
to jump start projects to improve the interconnected transmission grid in the 
Western states so that power can be quickly and efficiently moved to where it 
is needed. Prompt action on such projects could have helped alleviate the 
current problems, and they should commence with all due speed.

"Another factor that has driven the crisis is the lack of adequate generation 
facilities to power the growth of California and other Western states. We 
urge the Western Governors Association to take the lead in helping to chart a 
course that will bring more facilities on line and provide short and long 
term solutions to these difficulties.

"Even though we have been assured that PG&E employees will still be paid, and 
we know that their pensions are protected by law, we will fight to ensure 
that our collective bargaining rights are honored during this process. We 
will work with our Local Union 1245, utility management, Governor Davis and 
all other parties to restore sanity and reliability to California's gas and 
electricity systems."

Reliant Energy Says Bankruptcy Action By Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Not 
Unexpected

PR Newswire
04/06/01, 4:11p
(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)

HOUSTON, April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI) said today that 
the bankruptcy filing announced by Pacific Gas and Electric Company was not 
an unexpected occurrence and does not increase Reliant Energy's financial 
exposure.

Steve Letbetter, Reliant Energy chairman, president, and chief executive 
officer, said Reliant Energy planned for such a possibility during the fourth 
quarter 2000 and continues to do so.

"Our exposure to financial risk as a result of Pacific Gas and Electric's 
action is not expected to increase," Letbetter said. "This development does 
not impact the level of first quarter results we have previously anticipated. 
We established a $39 million reserve in the fourth quarter of 2000, and we 
will continue to reserve appropriate funds."

According to Letbetter, bankruptcy is one of the mechanisms that will get 
outstanding receivables paid and can be a part of an overall, constructive 
solution to California's energy crisis.

"Despite this bankruptcy action, Reliant Energy will continue to work with 
the state to ensure our generating plants are available to serve California's 
electricity needs," Letbetter said. "We remain committed to helping find a 
long-term solution to California's energy crisis."

Reliant Energy plans to release its earnings on Monday, April 16.

Reliant Energy, based in Houston, Texas, is an international energy services 
and energy delivery company with approximately $29 billion in annual revenue 
and assets totaling more than $32 billion. The company has more than 23,000 
megawatts of power generation in operation in the U.S. and is one of only 
three companies to rank among both the five largest power marketers and the 
five largest natural gas marketers in the nation. The company also has 
wholesale trading and marketing operations and more than 3,400 megawatts of 
power generation in Western Europe. Reliant Energy's retail marketing and 
distribution operations serve nearly four million electricity and natural gas 
customers in the U.S., and its Internet infrastructure and communications 
company serves business customers in Texas.

Sempra Energy And SDG&E Reaffirm Strong Financial Position in Response to 
PG&E Bankruptcy

Business Wire
04/06/01, 4:00p
(Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001--Sempra Energy and San Diego Gas & 
Electric (SDG&E) officials took the opportunity of today's Chapter 11 
bankruptcy announcement by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) to reaffirm their 
companies' strong financial position and the significant regulatory and 
legislative differences between SDG&E and PG&E.

"We want to reassure our customers and shareholders that Sempra Energy and 
SDG&E remain very strong and financially viable companies," said Stephen L. 
Baum, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy, the 
parent company of SDG&E. "SDG&E is continuing its record of providing safe 
and reliable gas and electric service for our 1.2 million customers today, 
tomorrow and for years to come. There are several significant financial, 
legislative and regulatory differences that distinguish Sempra Energy and 
SDG&E from PG&E."

SDG&E is covered under Assembly Bill 265, a law signed by the Governor last 
September which guaranteed that SDG&E will be able to collect the difference 
between the capped price of electricity and the wholesale cost of power, 
providing the power was prudently purchased. PG&E is not covered by AB 265 
and that guarantee. At the end of February, the under-collection in the 
balancing account was $681 million. Since the state's power procurement 
agency, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), has been 
purchasing power for SDG&E, the growth of the company's balancing account has 
slowed significantly.

Unlike PG&E, SDG&E has been able to pay its wholesale electric bills to the 
DWR, the California Independent System Operator, the California Power 
Exchange and Qualifying Facilities that cogenerate power for the utility. 
Additionally, the Sempra Energy companies have no significant credit exposure 
to PG&E.

"Sempra Energy and SDG&E have long advocated that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission institute temporary regional wholesale price caps to 
help stem the financial problems such as those experienced by PG&E," Baum

Fitch Cuts Pacific Gas and Electric, So Cal Edison Ratings

Business Wire
04/06/01, 4:57p
(Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001--Fitch has lowered its ratings for 
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Pac Gas) senior secured and preferred 
securities into the default category based on the utility's voluntary filing 
today of a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Fitch also believes that Pac Gas' bankruptcy filing could complicate Southern 
California Edison's (So Cal Ed) likelihood of accomplishing a sale of its 
transmission assets to the State of California. Consequently, Fitch has 
lowered So Cal Ed's senior secured debt rating and changed the Ratings Watch 
to Negative from Evolving. The Ratings Watch status of Edison International, 
the parent of So Cal Ed, is also changed to Negative from Evolving. The new 
ratings are:

Pacific Gas and Electric Company

   First Mortgage Bonds to `DDD' from `B-`;
   Preferred Securities to `D' from `C';
   Commercial Paper `D' Unchanged;
   Rating Watch Not applicable Negative.

   Fitch does not rate the securities of PG&E Corp.

   Southern California Edison Company

   Senior Secured Debt to `CCC' from `B-`;
   Senior Unsecured Debt `CC' unchanged;
   Preferred Stock `C' unchanged;
   Commercial Paper `D' unchanged;
   Changed to Rating Watch Negative from Rating Watch Evolving.

   Edison International

   Senior Unsecured Notes `CC' unchanged;
   Trust Preferred Securities `C' unchanged;
   Commercial Paper `D' unchanged;
   To Rating Watch Negative from Rating Watch Evolving.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of PG&E Corp., 
and is based in San Francisco, CA. Southern California Edison is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Edison International, and is based in Rosemead, 
California.

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Locker today released the following 
statement regarding Pacific Gas & Electric's decision to file for bankruptcy:

"The uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers 
has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of California's oldest 
businesses. While this is a significant and unwelcome development, our team 
of bankruptcy litigators has been
preparing for several months to defend California taxpayers in the event of a 
utility bankruptcy. This morning, I spoke with a PG&E executive, and he 
personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay 
the state for its purchase of energy and
to repay its renewable energy supplier-creditors ("qualified facilities"). I 
am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent 
necessary. Over the last several months, our state attorneys have fought hard 
in the courts to ensure that out-of-state
generators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies 
to Californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the state's 
two major utilities. The health and safety of Californians and the future of 
our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy 
business decisions of generators, marketers and utilities. Justice requires 
that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of 
Californians must pay back what they owe. I will use all the considerable 
resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the 
bills affordable for every California home and business, to recover 
California tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly 
taken, and to punish wrongdoers."

AWARD TO INFORMANTS

"It is possible that one or more members of the public can help with 
information, and if so, the financial reward to such a person or persons 
could be enormous. My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into 
whether energy providers have violated any laws. Over the last four years, 
state and local government agencies have spent billions of dollars in state 
and local taxpayer money to purchase electricity and natural gas. Under 
California false claims law, any person or corporation who obtains state 
taxpayer money by fraud or illegal acts is liable for financial penalties 
that can be as high as three times the actual losses. And anyone who provides 
information leading to the successful prosecution of a false claim action may 
be entitled to a percentage share in that award. Since billions of state 
dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant could potentially range 
from $50 million to the
hundreds of millions of dollars. I am asking any member of the public with 
personal knowledge of any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction 
in the California supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or 
electricity to contact my office immediately by calling: 1-800-952-5225 (w/in 
CA) or (916) 322-3360 (local or out of state), or e-mail the Attorney 
General's Energy Emergency Task Force at energywhistleblower@doj.ca.gov."

Jeff & Mona:  We have confirmed that our contracts are silent on the issue.  
Question remains as to what the language of the original decision was...Can 
you suggest someone who can dig into this for us?  Should I just phone Mike 
Day?  Let me know...MLC

Likely needs to be a legal analysis based on the language of the original 
decision etablishing the credits.  But seems to me that we have a deal with 
our customers to receive service according to price, terms and conditions 
stated in our contracts with those customers, and that the contract language 
would govern how the credit is treated.  If  the contracts don't speak to the 
issue of credits, seems that our contract agrees to provide rez customers 
with service for a a certain price, and as such, it would be up to us whether 
we flow it through.  But a lawyer, I am not.  Are our contracts silent on the 
issue?

Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:

Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
Credits.

Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
(per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?

Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?

Who could handle this issue for Diane?

Thanks, KC

you bet.  you're on.

NEWSMAKER PROFILE 
Dennis Montali 
Bankruptcy Judge Faces Challenge of His Career 
Well-known expert in complex cases 
Harriet Chiang, Chronicle Legal Affairs Writer

N180032.DTL 
A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots 
in California's long, drawn-out power crisis. 
Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot- 
coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is 
about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is 
relishing the challenge. 
"He's one of the best judges in the country," said Lawrence Goldberg, a San 
Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. "He 
loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court." 
Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who 
often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of 
bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more 
complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes. 
On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of 
the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a 
mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say. 
"He's an excellent draw for the case," said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn 
Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali 
has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him 
understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis. 
Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay 
Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and 
later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The 
young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and 
then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps 
commitment. 
After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt 
School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968. 
He joined the law firm of 
Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in 
bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison & 
Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert. 
While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's 
attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his 
knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community. 
In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening 
on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California. 
One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in 
doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with 
crises quickly and with few complications. 
He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of 
Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was 
rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel. 
When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian 
food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk 
his dog and spend time with his granddaughter. 
"He's going to put his heart into this one," said Larry Engel, a veteran 
bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. "He's got 
the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence." 
"California," he added, "is in really good hands in having the case with 
him."

When to Hold 'Em, Fold 'Em: It might be a long time before PG&E shares 
rebound 
Kathleen Pender
Saturday, April 7, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

U172804.DTL 

If you own PG&E stock, you really need to ask yourself whether you're 
prepared to endure the agony of the next few years. 
When companies go bankrupt, common stockholders are the last to be paid, 
after trade, secured and unsecured creditors. 
Because there are usually not enough assets to pay off all those creditors in 
full, in many cases the creditors give up part of their claims in exchange 
for stock in the reorganized company that emerges from bankruptcy. This 
vastly dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. 
In many cases, the original shareholders end up with a small fraction of 
stock in the reorganized company. And that's after a protracted court 
proceeding that could take two to five years. During that period, there's 
little reason for the stock to rise. 
Although it was Pacific Gas & Electric -- PG&E Corp.'s utility subsidiary -- 
that filed for bankruptcy yesterday, stock in the parent company fell $4.18 
per share to $7.20, and most Wall Street investors see little hope for a 
quick rebound. 
"This is going to be a long, drawn-out process," says Claude Cody, manager of 
AIM Global Utilities Fund, which owns stock in PG&E. "There is going to be 
negative news and positive news, and generally the negative news comes out 
first." 
Cody explains that when a company is in bankruptcy, the flow of information 
slows down. Many institutional investors won't own stock in a bankrupt 
company, 
and analysts stop following it. 
All the usual methods of valuing a stock, such as price-earnings ratios, 
become meaningless. 
Companies in bankruptcy hardly ever pay dividends. 
PG&E has already suspended its dividend and won't pay one as long as the 
utility is in bankruptcy. 
That's hard on people such as Lee Fischer of San Bruno, who bought PG&E stock 
20 years ago. Fischer, 72, says PG&E accounted for about 15 percent of the 
stock dividends he depends on for retirement income. 
"Everybody said, 'Buy utilities, buy oil, they're always going to be there, ' 
" he says. 
"I'm pretty upset with our governor. I'm mad at PG&E. They're making 
decisions we have no control over. I'm already losing the money I'm putting 
into my monthly (utility) bills. It's not fair. My emotions are running 
rampant at this point." 
There are some reasons Fischer and other PG&E shareholders could fare better 
than most stockholders involved in a typical bankruptcy. 
For one thing, shareholders own stock in the parent company, which has some 
unregulated energy assets that could provide cash flow and some support for 
the stock price, provided that creditors of the utility can't seize the 
assets of the unregulated subsidiary. 
PG&E has taken steps to prevent that, but those steps are sure to be 
challenged in court -- a process that could add to the length and complexity 
of the utility's bankruptcy proceeding. 
"In most bankruptcy cases, you don't have this two-sided isolation. 
Shareholders are not getting money from a solvent side while there's an 
insolvent side," says Lynn LoPucki, a law professor with the University of 
California at Los Angeles. 
Given its size, stature, the essential nature of its product and its 
importance to the state's economy, some experts say PG&E's bankruptcy could 
be resolved relatively quickly -- maybe in two years instead of three. 
For the very same reasons, others say it will bog down. 
PG&E stock is down 77 percent from its high last September. But that doesn't 
mean it can't go lower. 
Walter Torous, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at 
UCLA, has studied what happens to stocks after bankruptcies and found that on 
average, they don't do well. 
"You'd think that if a company announces bankruptcy it takes a one-time hit. 
But it continues to underperform badly over the long term. The market doesn't 
seem to quickly incorporate this bad news," says Torous. 
Torous tracked 78 large companies that filed for bankruptcy between 1979 and 
1983. 
He found that during the first year after they filed, their stocks trailed 
the overall market by 38 percentage points. Over two years, they 
underperformed by 57 percentage points. Over three years, they trailed by 
almost 100 percentage points. (He explains that if the market went up 50 
percent and the bankrupt stocks went down by 50 percent, they would trail by 
100 percentage points). 
Torous says that because the companies he studied all went bankrupt around 
the same time, they might not be representative of companies going bankrupt 
during other periods. 
Marty Whitman, manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund, points out that in 
past utility bankruptcies -- such as Public Service Co. of New Hampshire and 
Northeast Utilities -- shareholders who held on came out well, after a number 
of years. 
"In other utility bankruptcies, they've all been reorganized on the backs of 
the ratepayers and taxpayers," he says. 
Whitman, who doesn't own PG&E stock but does own secured bonds in the 
utility, was irate yesterday that PG&E didn't "prepackage" its bankruptcy. 
That would have involved getting all the parties involved to agree to a 
reorganization plan before filing for bankruptcy. 
"If they did it preplanned, they could be in and out (of bankruptcy) in six 
months," Whitman says. 
Instead, he says it could take two to three years. 
Mark Luftig, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities Fund, does not own 
the stock and considers it a highly speculative investment. "If you can put 
it away for three years, there's an above-average chance you'll get an above- 
average return," says Luftig. "Will you miss a lot of sleep in the meantime? 
Probably." 
MOODY'S GROWS NERVOUS: Debt-rating agency Moody's said yesterday that it 
changed its outlook on the state of California's general obligation bonds to 
negative from stable, "reflecting our view that the deepening electric power 
crisis -- compounded by (yesterday's) bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. -- has increased the risks to the state's otherwise strong 
fiscal and economic condition." 
Moody's is the second bond-rating agency to warn that it might downgrade the 
state's credit rating because of the power crisis. 
In January, Standard & Poor's put the state's credit rating, currently AA, on 
"CreditWatch" with negative implications.

Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action 
FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River 
Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the 
natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were 
happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
"The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the 
"precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword," warned 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC 
"should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action." 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action 
expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the 
"extraordinary regulatory treatment" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler 
Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she 
noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in 
the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how 
our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing 
electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said. If anything, 
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the 
project was certificated, she noted. "It would be counterproductive for this 
Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without 
ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more 
importantly, that they will cause no further harm." 
The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas 
and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, 
that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing 
customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over 
expansion shippers. 
"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative 
impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines," the order said 
[CP01-106. For starters, "the record does not show that pro-rata allocations 
of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge." Kern River 
reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at 
Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result 
of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the 
Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 
MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave 
Pipeline shippers, it noted. 
"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be 
greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. 
The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes 
attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to 
Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide 
sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers," the order said. 
"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at 
Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing 
the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation 
path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction." 
The project would increase the "limited-term, incremental transportation 
capacity" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help 
address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 
horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor 
stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and 
an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has 
a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. 
Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the 
project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced 
by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending 
at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of 
the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project 
recently went through an open season

"The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San 
Diego" (April 2001) 
PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur
Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory 
more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000. 
Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate 
freeze. We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels 
in San Diego. We find that average electricity consumption decreased by 
roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August. Demand was 
reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening. Because of the 
uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase, 
these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that 
could be achieved through pricing incentives.

computer lab for modeling.  same thing this thursday.

Here's some stuff I worked on over the weekend.  OAT's balance sheet and 
income statement and common-sized.  Haven't put together the cash flow yet.  
Please take a look.  Really wanted to get something in a file for folks to 
start looking at so that, together with the materials Anil and Carolyn have 
pulled together, we can start filling in our assumptions and doing some 
valuations.  I can do the same for Coke and Pepsi.  

Take a peek and let's try to discuss by email.  Or I'm up for a conference 
call tomorrow or Wednesday (or a meeting in person) if you folks are game.

I attended the hearings on PGE's two cash collateral motions today.  Both 
were granted on an interim basis.  The court set a final hearing for May 9 at 
9:30 am.  PGE is to file its pleadings by April 20 and any opposition is due 
by May 4.

The bondholder cash collateral motion was heard first.  There was no 
opposition and the bond trustee (Bank of New York) consented to the relief.  
BONY and PGE are working on a final cash collateral stipulation.

Next was the gas supplier motion.  PGE mentioned in its presentation that the 
basis of the pre-petition agreement was the waiver of termination rights in 
the event of bankruptcy by the suppliers in return for a security interest in 
the receivables.  Jim Lopes, PGE's lawyer, mentioned that he had learned a 
great deal about Bankruptcy Code section 556 in the last few months.  Judge 
Montali nodded his head at that comment.  Montali also asked whether PGE 
conceded that 556 applied.  Lopes answered that he did not concede that it 
applied, but he was "very concerned."

I asked whether the post-petition security interest was available to 
suppliers that were not parties to the pre-petition agreements.  The Court 
said that was up to PGE; Lopes said they were willing to talk about it, but 
they did not want to grant liens to all of their creditors and hoped 
creditors would rely on their administrative claims, which PGE believes will 
be paid in the ordinary course.  Procedurally, the Court said it would not 
authorize any new security interests on the basis of the interim order 
resulting from today's hearing.  Instead, that would have to be the subject 
of a separate motion with notice, and perhaps coujld be taken up at the final 
hearing.
P
 GE also indicated that it is filing today a lawsuit against the CPUC seeking 
a TRO regarding a deadline of April 11 for the filing of certain advice 
letters.  A hearing is tentatively scheduled on the TRO for 3 pm tomorrow, 
April 10.

There was also discussion of various administrative matters, like scheduling 
hearings, entering a case management order, etc.

A representative of a consumer group, the Coalition for Public Power, read a 
statement asking Judge Montali to rollback rates and to force PGE's parent to 
pay the utility's debts.  The Judge let them speak, but made it clear that it 
was not an action item, and seemed generally to ignore them.

The courtroom was packed with attorneys, journalists and members of the 
public.  After the hearing, the reporters all descended upon the attorneys 
for PGE and the CPUC.  The courtroom is in an office building in SF's 
financial district; there were probably ten TV cameras set up on the sidewalk 
as well as several protesters carrying signs.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Dear Energy Committee Member -

I just spoke with two of Governor Davis' top energy advisors.  As you know,
the Governor mentioned the need for a rate increase in his televised address
last Thursday night.  While his speech, and corresponding notes, went into
some detail on how that increase would impact residential customers, it did
not go into great detail on the increase to commercial customers.

As you know, the PUC's proposed increase was not at all proportional
relative to use by residential and commercial customers, and the
corresponding rate increase for each.  SVMG has long argued that some level
of increase would probably be necessary, but that any rate increase should
be proportional to use.  For instance, since residents use approximately
one-third of the power, then residential customers should absorb one-third
of the increase (taking into account, of course, the most vulnerable
residents), and commercial customers should absorb the two-thirds in a way
that is proportional to use.

I am encouraged by my phone call with the Governor's advisors, in that they
seemed to agree strongly that the PUC proposal was not at all proportional,
and seemed to concur that such a disproportional structure would be damaging
to California employers.  They are going to send me more details tomorrow
(Tuesday) about the Governor's plan, and I will then pass that information
along.

In the meantime, I hope this limited information helps, and will keep you
posted as I learn more.

Sincerely,

Carl Guardino

(of this week).
Topics for discussion include:

1. The "California Plan" that Jeff and I must provide to Rick.  I'll 
circulate a draft later this week.

Eliz -- I need your group to put together a search which captures the 
comments of PG&E and Edison officials in trade press, anlyst reports, and 
speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover 
their shortfall.  In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 
passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their "rate 
reduction bonds" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm 
sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the 
risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.

California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk

By REBECCA SMITH

Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

California's two biggest utilities are losing so much
money buying electricity in the state's deregulated
market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half
their net worth in just four months.

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the
price these utilities are allowed to bill their
customers, as currently seems likely, they could become
technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put
pressure on regulators to orchestrate a
multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the "too
big to fail'' response that in the past pushed
governments to rescue banks.

Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating
concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based
PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of
Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating
concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt
can be borne by the two affected utilities before they
will have difficulty paying their bills.

Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New Plants
Aren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11)

Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, From
Deregulation (Sept. 6)

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs
(Sept. 1)
"If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can
get through it," says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch
IBCA. "If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very
serious situation." Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit
officer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: "At some
point, you have a financial crisis."

The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting
expenses and don't envision problems in servicing their
debts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal
regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping
somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. The
California utilities' experience may be a harbinger of
what could happen in other states where wholesale power
prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are
allowed to charge their ratepayers.

For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the
financial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility
that serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seeking
approval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.
It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping
$250 million from the commercial paper market. "This is
going to be a long, tough road," says Jim Scilacci, chief
financial officer for Southern California Edison.

Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from
what was expected when California deregulated its energy
market on March 31, 1998, which opened electricity
pricing to competition. California tried to give its
utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating
faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to
allow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison,
to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers
under the old regulatory system.

To do this, the state legislature set retail rates at
high levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses for
the utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used it
to pay down debts for generation facilities that were
otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. By
the end of this June, PG&E and Edison together had
collected more than $12 billion and were on track to
finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,
2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,
rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to
fluctuate with the market.

But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale
power prices surged, topping the rates the utilities were
allowed to charge retail customers. Average prices at
state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times
the prices of a year earlier, and three to four times the
level utilities could charge customers.

The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,
that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by
Oct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7
billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.
Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit
of $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net
worth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they have
been accumulating deficits, aren't required to report
these as losses on their earnings statements.

That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the
rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of
electricity to consumers. But should the freeze end
before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get
clobbered. That is because they will immediately have to
book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's
more, they can't use the proceeds from planned
power-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, should
the freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some of
the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refunds
could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the
amount is $254 million.

Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism
will be found to let them recoup the money spent on
electricity.

Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie
Hoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer group
Utility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end up
footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that
benefited them before prices shot up.

Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the
legislation that got them into such a mess, which was
drafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn
says it is best not to "overanalyze" the "old deal."
Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit
down with utilities and construct a new agreement, since
"it's in the broad interests of the state not to have
critical energy infrastructure look like a leper."

Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers "mutually assured
destruction" to both utilities and ratepayers. Something
must be done, he says, or consumers throughout most of
the state will experience "a San Diego-style rate shock."
The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., ended its freeze a year ago and began passing
wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.
Legislators intervened this summer, however, and
temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills
nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is
also accumulating a deficit as a result.

So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities
will be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analysts
say. "Until we hear politicians of consequence state
otherwise, our position is that we believe the utilities
will be made whole," says Richard Cortright, a director
at Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group.

But that opinion could change if it looks like the
utilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result:
lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and
could trigger a downward spiral. "You're talking about
top-rated companies, though," said Ms. Woodland of Fitch
IBCA. "To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen."

In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to
control the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority from
regulators to buy more power under long-term contracts at
fixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-market
volatility. And they have petitioned federal regulators
to declare California's market so badly flawed that
generators should be denied market pricing and, even,
ordered to pay refunds.

Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.
Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remain
high for those as well. What's more, they can't buy less
power than their customers need. If they don't buy
enough, the California Independent System Operator, the
organization responsible for reliability, will step in
and make purchases for them and send them the bill.

Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,
though, is one of timing. The California legislature is
out of session until December, and regulators haven't
even really started to address the issue formally. In the
meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of
millions of dollars daily.

Folks in Sacramento said that they haven't heard anything about it and aren't 
inclined to inquire.  It's about 99% certain that we'll be "invited" to 
appear before the committee that's doing the wholesale price investigations, 
however, and very likely that we'll be served with a substantial number of 
questions in advance of that appearance.  I'll stay on top of it and let you 
know just as soon as I do.  If there's anything else, don't hesitate.

Jeff - Have you been able to find out any information regarding the Gas Daily 
article which stated that your legislators were investigating EOL?   Thanks,

Greetings.  I had a blast skiing--been way to long.  I haven't called 
Ashish.  I'll pick someone off of your list to call.  Hope to see you soon.

Hi Jeff-
Howz it going?  Long time no see - we need to do a happy hour so that we can
catch up!  Hope you had a blast at the Resort at Squaw of couple of weekends
ago.  Wasn't it a gorgeous weekend!  

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list
of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question
around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a
similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him. 

If you have already called him, don't worry about it.  If not, go ahead and
we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish.  Just let me know
who you pick on my list!

Take care,
Deepika 

 

Comrades:

Attached you will find the call assignments for the
new admits.  We all have five or six people to call in
the next 7-10 days.   I made a couple of matches where
it seemed there was some kind of similarity in
background or career, but for the most part, the
assignments were essentially random.  The list
includes names, phones at home and work, company and
title.

Remember these are newly admitted students who have
not yet accepted our offer of admission.  The deadline
to accept this offer is April 27th.

A general outline of the phone call, should you choose
to use it, would be:

1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas
School

2) indentify yourself as "involved with the student
government at the Haas School, and the evening office
asked me to give you a call to see if you had any
questions about the program.  Then answer the
questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for
further follow-up

3)describe your own experience at school and how it
has worked with your career--timing, advancement,
scheduling, tuition payments, etc.

4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them
around.  EMBA office will coordinate.

5)remind them of the "New Students Admit Reception" on
April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks
and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent
email for other particulars. 

Some pieces of information you might want to have
handy
 
-required new student orientation is August 11-12;
classes start on the 13th

-fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required,
including the two units for MPAR

-orientation packages will be sent out mid-June

-administration will call each new student in July
with class schedules

-second round of admits come out in early June

Thanks very much for helping.  Let me know if there is
anything else you may need or could suggest to help in
this effort.

Here's how I think this thing has played (is playing) out:

PG&E was very tactical.
They knew that the Edison deal was imminent.
They see the Edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests.
They feared that the pressure on them to do the same deal would be enormous 
once the Governor announced the Edison deal.
Thus, in an incredibly dramatic attempt to pre-empt the possibility that 
they'd have to accept the Edison deal, PG&E threw itself into bankruptcy.  
(Preemption seems to have been very successful, at least at this point.)
So I think that they wanted everyone to know, including Wall Street and the 
Governor, that the decision's been made---they're going the way of Ch. 11, 
not the way of J. Bryson and Edison.

This make sense?

Best,
Jeff

What was the point of that statement?  It sure seemed like a non-statement...

FYI.  PCG is up $1.6 as we speak.

Hi.  Any word on the mower?  

very sorry.  hang in there.

Here are the components as I see them:

1999 numbers for C&I are fine; I'd do 10%, 15%, 20% reductions.
Assume C&I takes its proportionate share of the DWR's net short (i.e., if C&I 
is 2/3 of load, then 2/3 of CDW purchases should go to C&I)
You can use the average price used in the DWR presentation to Legislators to 
the $ amount.  The copy I've got sez that the average price for the first 5 
years is $79/MWH.  That seems like the # we ought to use.
Now the hard part.  The state reportedly sez that they aren't buying the 
entire net short---only that part that they feel like covering.  So how do we 
factor that in?  Not sure that we can get detailed data (but check with Alan 
Comnes, who might be able to provide ISO real time prices (which is where the 
net short (of the net short) is being filled ISO---the ISO then sends that 
bill to PG&E.
An easier way might be to use PG&E's numbers.  In their bankruptcy 
announcement, PG&E sez that it's been costing them $300MM per month ($300MM * 
0.67 * 0.10 =~$20MM).  We could scale this number up to account for summer 
purchases.
Alternatively, we could use ENA's forward curve.

This is very quick and dirty (apologies) and I may have gotten something very 
wrong.  If I've got any fatal flaws in the thinking (which happens often), 
please point them out.  And if you have any questions, don't hesitate.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:

Robert and I wanted to follow up with you on your question about savings that 
could be realized if 10% of lg. C&Is found other energy suppliers.
Please provide a bit more info. about what you are interested in:

*Would it be a subtraction of 10% of C&I load or customers?
*How precise do we need to be, i.e., can I estimate figures based on 1999 
load?

It is probably best to reply via e-mail.

Thanks, Jennifer

God help us.

Works for me.

That is so cool. Congratulations.  That ain't an easy job (you know how 
traders are); but you'll do great.  Where's Christi going?

Could be.  What is our post-12/31/00 exposure?

Interesting bit from SCE's MOU (p. 31) -

"the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include

Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; "

Translation:  I suppose this means SCE is looking for an order absolving it 
of any responsibility for PX credits after 12/31/00, but implicitly, that 
seems to suggest they accept responsibility for PX credits before 12/31/00.  
Do you agree?

Thanks.

FYI.  The Negative PX Credit language in the MOU reads (on p.31):

"the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include

Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; "

Could go several different ways, but arguably could be read to say that SCE 
will make good on credits up to 12.31.2000.  If that were the case, I'm 
assuming that about 75-90% of our exposure would be covered?

Best,
Jeff

Eldoni:

I'm assuming, since I haven't heard back, that we're going to take a pass 
this time on the Dome road, and perhaps have Jeff Green do it another time?  
If I'm incorrect, we'll need to get things squared away, like today.

Let me know,
Jeff

Ouch.

So it could be one way or the other...

	MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com>
	04/10/2001 04:05 PM
		 
As I told Bob in an earlier email, I noticed this same provision. However,
it could be implemented in one of two ways.  Either finding that SCE is not
liable for negative CTC credits after that date, or holding that it is
liable and providing for cost recovery.  Either is consistent with the
language in the MOU.  We will need to explore this more, and possibly talk
to SCE.  Mike Day

Greetings:

Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
following.

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
Commissioner).  

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
FERC do "its part" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.

Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.

Overall, the "no price cap" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
under considerable pressure to give in to caps).

The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
letter.

Best,
Jeff

Not a problem.  There's 3 feet of power at Squaw.

The interest on the charges was $500.

I'll take care of that debt. What a joke! What happened when you put the 
room on my card, Cameron? Why did I get so rejected at the ATM all weekend?

Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action 
FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River 
Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the 
natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were 
happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
"The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the 
"precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword," warned 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC 
"should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action." 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action 
expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the 
"extraordinary regulatory treatment" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler 
Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she 
noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in 
the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how 
our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing 
electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said. If anything, 
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the 
project was certificated, she noted. "It would be counterproductive for this 
Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without 
ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more 
importantly, that they will cause no further harm." 
The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas 
and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, 
that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing 
customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over 
expansion shippers. 
"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative 
impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines," the order said 
[CP01-106. For starters, "the record does not show that pro-rata allocations 
of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge." Kern River 
reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at 
Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result 
of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the 
Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 
MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave 
Pipeline shippers, it noted. 
"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be 
greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. 
The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes 
attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to 
Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide 
sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers," the order said. 
"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at 
Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing 
the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation 
path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction." 
The project would increase the "limited-term, incremental transportation 
capacity" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help 
address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 
horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor 
stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and 
an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has 
a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. 
Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the 
project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced 
by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending 
at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of 
the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project 
recently went through an open season

Pleasure's all mine.

Power deregulation backfires in infancy (9.27.2000)
MANY OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL WORK EVENTUALLY 
BY STEVE JOHNSON
Mercury News 
With its residents reeling from surging summertime electricity bills, this 
coastal state's deregulated energy market has triggered bitter accusations, 
legislative hearings and a push to re-regulate the whole system. 
Sound familiar? Except this isn't California. It's New York, one of 23 other 
states that are ending what has been for decades one of government's key 
functions -- keeping tight control on the price of power. 
The great national experiment to open the sale of electricity to competition, 
which California has been largely credited with pioneering, was supposed to 
lower prices by freeing consumers from the monopolistic grip of government 
regulated utilities. Indeed, energy officials in many states retain hope that 
it eventually will do that. 
But throughout the country, a sense of foreboding has overtaken people like 
Susan Peckman, who manages Peckman's Liquor Store in Pearl River, N.Y. Hers 
is the only state outside California so far where consumers have been exposed 
to the discomfitting impact of fully deregulated prices. And she doesn't feel 
liberated. 
``There's nothing we can do about it,'' said Peckman, who estimated that her 
store's electricity bill has jumped about 20 percent this summer over last 
year's. Faced with the option of paying it or closing down, she added, 
``you're between a rock and a hard place.'' 
It has been four years since California became one of the first states to 
pass an energy deregulation law. Yet the movement to revamp the way power is 
sold in this country remains mired in a ``prolonged and muddled transition,'' 
according to a study published this month by Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates and the Arthur Andersen consulting firm. 
It's unclear when or even if that transition will ever be completed. In many 
parts of the country, public officials are terrified of plunging ahead with 
deregulation, given the high prices and other problems in California and New 
York. Some even harbor suspicions that California has led the nation astray 
by promoting an idea that is inherently flawed. 
California Public Utilities Commissioner Henry Duque said he encountered that 
attitude during a summer meeting of the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners in Los Angeles. 
``I had other commissioners coming up to me saying, `What the hell is going 
on here,' '' Duque said. ``They were concerned. I think their thought was, 
did we in California see something that was wrong with deregulation but 
weren't going to level with them now that they had started down the path?'' 
Actually, the federal government bears much of the responsibility for 
initiating the drive to ease public control of electricity markets. 
Hoping to encourage new sources of electricity, Congress passed laws in 1978 
and 1992 that forced utility companies to buy increasing amounts of the power 
they use from other, unregulated energy suppliers. In 1996, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission also made it possible for other firms to ship 
their power over the high-voltage lines the utilities owned. 
Consumers were looking for a change, too. By the mid-1990s, the service 
provided by utility firms had become a sore subject. California had some of 
the highest utility rates in the country, and the electrical system's 
reliability was under fire. 
If only other companies could be lured into the market to compete, it was 
widely assumed, prices would plummet and overall customer satisfaction would 
improve. 
New York, New Hampshire and Rhode Island passed laws or made administrative 
rulings to deregulate slightly before California, where deregulation was 
approved in September 1996. 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts were first to give residents the ability to 
choose which company sold them their electricity. But because of its size and 
much publicized deliberations about its plan to deregulate during the 1990s, 
California was labeled the national leader on the issue. 
In many ways, however, deregulation in the state has been a flop -- at least, 
so far. 
Californians have had the right to pick their energy supplier since March 31, 
1998, when the electricity market was officially unfettered. That ability to 
choose was seen as an essential way to spur competition and, ultimately, 
lower energy prices. 
But as of Aug. 15, less than 2 percent of California's homeowners, businesses 
and others had seen fit to drop their local utility for some other supplier. 
By contrast, in Pennsylvania -- one of 13 other states that now let people 
choose -- 10 percent of customers have switched. 
Critics say that's a misleading comparison since Pennsylvania, unlike 
California, gives an energy price discount to consumers who make the switch. 
Nonetheless, Pennsylvania officials are clearly happy about how deregulation 
is working. 
A study in August by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge concluded that electricity 
competition will result in 36,400 new jobs and a $1.4 billion boost in 
personal income across the state by 2004. 
``We do not anticipate the problems in Pennsylvania that you have out there 
in California,'' said Kevin Cadden, a spokesman with that state's Public 
Utility Commission. ``I am not nervous at all.'' 
A study this summer by the non-profit Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets, which promotes deregulation, found that Pennsylvania has pushed 
electricity competition more effectively and quickly than any other state. 
Others listed in order in the top 10 were New York, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Texas, Nevada, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. California 
was 16th. 
But consumers may have a different measure of success: whether their lights 
will stay on and how much electricity will cost them once government controls 
are removed. Unfortunately, in the two states where prices have been fully 
deregulated, the evidence is not encouraging. 
In San Diego, the first place in California to have its state-mandated cap on 
utility rates lifted under deregulation, electricity bills for many consumers 
this summer doubled, while power blackouts also rolled through Northern 
California. New York's experience wasn't quite as bad. But in the few 
counties there that were exposed to fully deregulated electricity rates this 
summer, the average residential bill rose 22 percent. 
Investigations are under way in California and New York to determine what 
happened. Nonetheless, the problems in both states have been largely blamed 
on an insufficient supply of power plants to meet their demand for 
electricity, which has forced consumers to pay just about whatever 
power-producing firms want to charge. 
``It's the piece that the economists missed'' when deregulation was touted 
several years ago, said Mike Donovan, a spokesman for Orange and Rockland 
Utilities, Inc., which supplies power to Susan Peckman's Pearl River liquor 
store, among other parts of New York. ``There isn't sufficient generation to 
really administer a full-scale competitive market.'' 
Ralph Cavanagh of the National Resources Defense Council in San Francisco 
maintains that deregulation has been unfairly maligned because the dearth of 
power plants has made it impossible for consumers to benefit from 
competition. Once that and some other problems are fixed, he said, ``I'm 
confident we'll have a more orderly market in the future.'' 
Others are growing nervous, however. This summer's difficulties have spurred 
calls to significantly stall or even reverse deregulation in North Carolina, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama, among other states. 
A Wisconsin consumer advocate recently chuckled over the phone as she read 
aloud a story about California's energy crisis, noting that such news made 
her opposition to deregulation much easier. 
``I am absolutely convinced that we are on an inexorable march toward the 
choice model,'' said Ken Malloy, president of the Center for the Advancement 
of Energy Markets. But he acknowledged that the experience in San Diego and 
New York ``is undeniably a bad thing that has happened to this movement, and 
it will set us back.''

Hi Jeff-
Howz it going?  Long time no see - we need to do a happy hour so that we can
catch up!  Hope you had a blast at the Resort at Squaw of couple of weekends
ago.  Wasn't it a gorgeous weekend!  

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list
of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question
around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a
similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him. 

If you have already called him, don't worry about it.  If not, go ahead and
we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish.  Just let me know
who you pick on my list!

Take care,
Deepika

Greetings:

Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
following.

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
Commissioner).  

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
FERC do "its part" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.

Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.

Overall, the "no price cap" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
under considerable pressure to give in to caps).

The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
letter.

Best,
Jeff

In Idaho, Western states press feds to act on power prices 
H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
Tuesday, April 10, 2001 
,2001 Associated Press 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2001/04/10/nation
al1812EDT0713.DTL 
(04-10) 18:04 PDT BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- High electricity prices pose a 
``looming disaster'' for many states in the West, a federal regulator warned 
Tuesday, as pressure grew on the government to consider temporary price 
controls on wholesale power. 
Officials from 11 Western states, including energy-ravaged California, 
engaged in sometimes passionate exchanges with three members of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission over how to contain soaring power prices that 
are expected to go only higher this summer. 
``Something has to be done to tame this market,'' Geoffrey Brown, a member of 
the California Public Utilities Commission, told the three FERC 
commissioners. California anticipates paying $65 billion for electricity this 
year, almost 10 times its power bill in 1999. 
But after the daylong session, the FERC seemed to be not much closer to 
imposing price caps than before, although one commissioner, Linda Breathitt, 
said she now wants to look the issue more carefully and might be swayed. 
FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a strong free-market advocate, reiterated his 
fear that price regulation would drive off investors for new power 
generation. Under FERC rules, it would be Hebert's discretion when or if to 
propose a price cap for deliberation. 
Commissioner William Massey, who has been in the minority on the commission 
in recommending price controls, said the ``passion for markets must be 
tempered with common sense.'' 
``We face a looming disaster,'' he declared, if wholesale electricity markets 
are allowed to continue on a path that has wholesale power in many parts of 
the West selling for 10 times what it cost just a year ago. 
Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to ensure just 
and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $124 million 
in refunds on California power sales. He also said the commission plans soon 
to approve a new system of tracking market abuses. 
The chairman noted that state officials at the meeting were sharply divided 
over whether the government should regulate electricity prices. Keeping tabs 
as each participant gave a presentation, he said three states were for them, 
five against and three uncertain. 
Hebert's anti-controls position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney 
in a telephone interview with Associated Press reporter David Ammons in 
Olympia, Wash. 
``The problem with price caps,'' Cheney said, ``is that they don't solve the 
problem. Just look at California, where they had caps applied at the retail 
level that, coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has 
driven PG&E into bankruptcy.'' 
Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said last week it had 
debts of $9 billion and filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 
11 of federal bankruptcy laws. 
California, whose electricity problems have unleashed soaring power prices 
throughout the West, urged FERC to immediately impose an 18-month cost-based 
price cap in the Western markets. 
``We have done our part. We cannot do it alone,'' said Bob Hertzberg, speaker 
of the California Assembly. He cited state actions to boost conservation, 
increase retail rates and speed up power plant construction and said there is 
``no earthly reason'' why energy prices should be 10 times what they were a 
year ago. 
Still, California officials expressed little optimism after the hearing. 
``It would take a dramatic, unprecedented change of direction'' for the FERC 
to adopt price controls, said Fred Keeley, speaker pro tem in the California 
Assembly, who was in the audience during the six-hour meeting. 
Breathitt, the FERC's third commissioner, who has not come out in favor of 
price caps, nevertheless indicated she might be inching toward some controls. 
She said she wants the commission to ``seriously discuss a price 
implementation plan.'' 
The issue may end up, however, being decided by two new commissioners 
recently nominated by President Bush -- Pat Wood, now head of the Texas 
utility commission, and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania regulator. 
Both are viewed as free market advocates, but pro-controls commissioner 
Massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price 
restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control. Neither 
nominee has yet been confirmed by the Senate. 
While divided on price controls, most of the state officials at the unusual 
FERC meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little 
to address problems in the power markets. 
The chairman of Montana's utility commission, Gary Feland, who opposes price 
controls, criticized FERC for lack of aggressiveness in challenging 
unreasonable prices. FERC is legally mandated to ensure ``just and 
reasonable'' wholesale power prices. 
``Montana is taking a hell of a hit'' from electricity prices, Feland said. 
``Politically we're getting beat up.'' 
Steve Ellenbecker, a utility commissioner from Wyoming, urged the federal 
regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure'' short of a price cap to 
deal with the troubled electricity market. 
Many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power 
prices have yet to hit consumers. In many cases state officials must still 
give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers.

I reviewed the Cal ISO filings below (in Sue's note) to determine general 
consistency with FERC orders on interconnection procedures.  Potential issues 
are identified below and you all can decide if Enron should protest/intervene 
(the West Developers may want to review this too).   Since I am not familiar 
with the Cal ISO procedures, I cannot determine whether protest is necessary 
(for example, PJM, NY, and NEPOOL have certain interconnection policies that 
would not be acceptable outside the pool, but that work ok for the pool).  
The TOs have also filed Amend. 39 interconnection procedures, but I have not 
looked at those to see if they mirror these.  Maybe one of the paralegals 
could check that.  In addition, one of you should review the filing letter 
and procedures to make sure that the statements made by Cal ISO are correct.

(Filing letter) The Cal ISO states that these procedures are filed in 
response to FERC's orders and that the Cal ISO and Market Participants are 
examining policies that will ensure that the ISO Controlled Grid is expanded 
to support competitive markets.  It also states that it would have liked to 
propose complementary changes to its long-term planning and expansion 
process, but other priorities have prevented it from doing so.
Discusses the two previously methodologies regarding interconnection 
procedures -- "No Grandfathering of Transmission Rights" and "Advance 
Congestion Cost Mitigation" (which was apparently rejected last year.
(Filing Letter at 10) -- Cal ISO does not propose a method of sharing upgrade 
costs, but states that the procedures do not preclude such a provision.  This 
is one we have used in other Inter. Agreements:  If required by law or if the 
Parties mutually agree to allow one or more third parties to use the 
Interconnection Facilities or any part thereof (whether by transfer of the 
Interconnection Facilities to an RTO or otherwise) and such use decreases the 
capacity of the Interconnection Facilities available to TO or the Facility or 
otherwise causes any detriment to TO or the Facility or benefits any party 
(including TO) other than Generator, or if TO is compensated for the costs of 
the Interconnection Facilities (in whole or in part) for any reason, 
Generator will be entitled to compensation from TO based upon the pro rata 
use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO, all third party users, and 
Generator, for the greater of (i) whatever costs Generator incurred in 
connection with the Interconnection Facilities, plus interest at the Interest 
Rate from the date of Generator's payment of the costs in connection with the 
Interconnection Facilities and (ii) the value that TO receives for the 
Interconnection Facilities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the 
Parties may use any other mutually agreed upon methodology to determine such 
compensation.
3.3 If one or more third parties are to use the Interconnection Facilities in 
accordance with Section ___, Generator's obligation to reimburse TO for the 
operation and maintenance costs incurred by TO in connection with the 
Interconnection Facilities shall be based on the pro rata use of the 
Interconnection Facilities by TO, all third parties users, and Generator, or 
on some other mutually agreed upon methodology; provided, however, that, 
under no circumstances shall Generator's share of TO's operation and 
maintenance costs be greater than its pro rata use of the Interconnection 
Facilities.
(Procedures) The timelines for submitting applications and responding to 
system impact studies (SIS) and facilities study (FS) are fine, per previous 
FERC orders (in fact, Cal ISO asks for 60 days to complete the Facilities 
Study -- PGE just filed requesting 90 days).
5.7.3.1.1.(c)  I would add "on a non-discriminatory basis" after "unless 
otherwise agreed by the ISO, and the Interconnecting PTO"
5.7.4.2 allows the generator to perform its own SIS and FS, subject to review 
by the Cal ISO and TO (this is a good provision that has not been adopted by 
many utilities).
5.7.4.2.1 -- The SIS will identify adverse impact on "Encumbrances" 
(undefined).  Someone needs to check this provision since I am not familiar 
with this Cal ISO rule.
5.7.4.2.2 -- A New Facility Operator is entitled to amend its Completed 
Application once without losing its queue spot.  Other utilities allow 
amendments as long as the change is not "material", which has only been 
defined by the utility and approved by FERC in several cases.  This Cal ISO 
proposed provision could be problematic to other generators in the queue if 
it is not limited to "material", (unless Enron is making the one time 
change!)  In any event, check with West Developers on this provision.
5.7.4.3 -- This provision requiring a New Facility Operator to execute (or 
have filed unsigned at FERC) an Interconnection Agreement within 10 days (if 
no upgrades) or within 30 days (if upgrades) can be a problem.  Cal ISO does 
not file a pro forma Interconnection Agreement in these procedures.  If Cal 
ISO tenders a poor interconnection agreement draft (which happens all the 
time with other utilities), then there is no way that Enron would typically 
want to execute it within those time limits.  For example, Duke did not file 
an pro forma interconnection agreement, but does allow 90 days for 
negotiation.  In my experience, the negotiation of the interconnection 
agreement can take a long time.  It would be advisable for the Cal ISO to 
file a pro forma at FERC, then you can protest, if necessary, and at least 
there will be a fairly decent interconnection agreement to use.
5.7.4.4.1(a)  -- The Queuing Milestones appear to be fairly rigid and quick:  
require the New Facility Operator to comply with the ISO tariff and the TO 
tariff and within 6 months of its Completed Application Date, satisfy all 
applicable Data Adequacy Requirements of state and local siting and other 
regulatory authorities.  I don't know that 6 months is achievable.  FERC has 
approved milestones in other cases, but most contain language requiring 
reasonable movement toward the milestones.  For example in Duke ER01-794 
Section 41.5: (Transmission Provider may reasonably extend any such milestone 
dates in the event of delays not caused by the Generation Interconnection 
Customer, such as unforeseen regulatory or construction delays that could not 
be remedied by Gen. Int. Customer through the exercise of due diligence, and 
may also reasonably extend milestone dates to which the Gen. Int. Customer 
has not agreed and which the Gen. Int. Customer has challenged at the 
Commission pending a Commission determination as to the reasonableness of 
such dates.)  In addition, the Cal ISO only allows one extension of 30 days 
-- probably not enough.
5.7.4.4.1 (b) -- requires a New Facility License within 15 months after 
satisfying the Data Adequacy Requirements.
5.7.5 -- does not provide for transmission credits for "network upgrades" 
(upgrades other than the costs of interconnection).  The Cal ISO recognized 
this exclusion in its filing letter at 11, but thinks that such issues are 
appropriately addressed as part of the process to revise the ISO's long-term 
grid planning process.  Enron has argued and won at FERC for transmission 
credits in other utility cases, but I don't know what is appropriate under 
Cal ISO system, so please check this carefully.

Jeff, this was filed last week.  The hearing is this morning. We are waiting

at the hearing today. 

Sue Mara (who's having computer problems today) just informed me that she's 
heard a rumor floating around that Lockyear (sp?), the CA Attorney General, 
or someone from his office, will file an amicus brief with the court today 
supporting UC's action against us.  We'll try to get more info and report 
back.  Vicki/Mike/Bob:  I'm assuming that you folks and/or our attorney's

Can you get in touch w/Eldon?  I've been unsuccessful the last two days.  May 
be too late at this point.  I was supposed to get in touch with Jeff 
beginning of the week so that he could order gravel.  And haven't even talked 
to him about the culvert.  If he does the culvert, Eldon's going to have to 
make sure that the other people on the road don't have a fit about Eldon

entail).

Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universities

Updated: April 11, 2001 - 2:06 p.m. 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of 
contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by 
its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities. 

Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a 
four-year deal with the California State University and University of 
California systems. 

Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the 
contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of 
skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 

Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers 
should pick up the tab. 

"It's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of 
dollars we can provide it for," Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He 
later described the case as being "all about money. It's all about money." 

Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's 
ruling in the suit brought by the state's two university systems. 

Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that 
Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a "marketing game" with 
the universities' promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times 
more than what the electricity cost Enron. 

He said lawmakers may have "left the keys in the car" when they approved 
California's failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy 
crisis, "But it is still theft to steal the car." 

The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue 
providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds. When the 
judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose 
the suit. 

"I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on 
the breach of contract claim," the judge said. 

UC's annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is 
about $26 million. CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and 
$20 million for natural gas. 

The case is UC Regents vs. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006. 

-- Associated Press 

You got it.  I'll put my thinking cap on and start pondering.

Jeff

In discussions with the Administration, it has become clear that there would 
be great political value in being able to  demonstrate (a) the economic value 
of open access for the US and (b) the impact open access would have on the 
current energy crisis.

Enron has developed historical analysis of the impact of deregulation on 
natural gas.  Margaret Carson is putting together some slides that show (1) 
throughput improvements, (2) expansion in pipeline capacity, and (3) cost 
reductions in the industry.  While not exactly identical, there are some good 
reasons to assume that the same would occur in the electricity industry.

It would be great if you could develop a general qualitative framework that 
would outline why open access is preferable in the very short-term and work 
on a larger quantitative framework over the medium-term.

To that end, Richard Tabors of TCA had earlier analyzed the economic loss 
from AEP's abuse of its transmission network last year.  He may have 
additional insights into developing this concept.

Please call me with further questions at 713-853-7673.

The goal of the Summit is simple - and critical: What IMMEDIATE steps can
each of us individually and collectively take to get California through the
summer months, to minimize rolling blackouts.  With that in mind, we will
focus on QUANTIFIABLE deliverables relative to conservation, load management
during peak periods, generation and state policies.

Special thanks to SVMG Member Company, Synopsys, for offering to host the
Summit, which will take place On Friday, May 4, from 8 a.m. (sharp) until 12
Noon at their Sunnyvale company site, 455 North Mary Avenue, Building 2.

Dennis:  Just wanted to bring this item to your attention.  We've researched 
the terms of our residential agreements and have noted that they are silent 
as to the issue of credits/refunds.  I've asked Jeff and Mike Day, our 
regulatory counsel in CA, for their input on whether we should refund these 
credits back to our residential customers.

 Notwithstanding  the fact that the language of the original decision 
allowing the credits does not address direct access customers, Jeff and Mike 
recommend, given the current climate in California, that we take action to 
refund these credits to our residential customers. 

 Just want to make sure you're "on board" with this before we direct CSC to 
refund the credit back to our residential accounts...Marianne

Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:

Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
Credits.

Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
(per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?

Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?

Who could handle this issue for Diane?

Thanks, KC

Wow. That's fascinating. Sounds neat.  I would be very concerned, though, 
given the current environment about having us listed as a sponsor.  In short, 
I would recommend against sponsoring, at least at this point.

Here is what I am thinking.  I would like to solicit among our esteemed
Board members sponsors for the dinner that evening.  I anticipate that
we would attract possibly 70+ guests and members, and the dinner bill
could be around $100/person with the open bar.  Which of you members
would like to be sponsors?  Will divide the cost equally among the
sponsors, and make sure to mention your names as sponsors for the

Jeff, Sue & Harry --

Michael and I are both in SF on Monday evening.  We were talking about 
getting together some time in the evening to put together a framework of our 
case around the Negative CTC in "bankruptcy" terms.

Does everyone agree and does the time work?

Jim

Can't wait for the bullets to start to fly.  Do we know what the total $ 
amount is to EES (if they were to book the entire credit to Enron)?  Thanks.

Dennis:  Just wanted to bring this item to your attention.  We've researched 
the terms of our residential agreements and have noted that they are silent 
as to the issue of credits/refunds.  I've asked Jeff and Mike Day, our 
regulatory counsel in CA, for their input on whether we should refund these 
credits back to our residential customers.

 Notwithstanding  the fact that the language of the original decision 
allowing the credits does not address direct access customers, Jeff and Mike 
recommend, given the current climate in California, that we take action to 
refund these credits to our residential customers. 

 Just want to make sure you're "on board" with this before we direct CSC to 
refund the credit back to our residential accounts...Marianne

Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:

Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
Credits.

Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
(per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?

Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?

Who could handle this issue for Diane?

Thanks, KC

It would be useful for me to have the opportunity to listen in on these 
calls.  Let me know if that's a problem.

I will plan on attending weekly.  Let me know if anyone else should go?

Jim

 Starting on Thursday,  April 19, at 2:00 p.m. there will be a weekly 
telephone conference for the California litigation team.  The objective will 
be to identify key issues and plan a coordinated strategy for all litigation 
in California.  The call will last not more than one hour.  

 Thus far, the responsibility has been allocated as follows:

1. PG&E Bankruptcy   Lisa Mellencamp and Carl Ecklund (LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & 
McRae)

2. Class Actions   Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs (Gibbs & Bruns)

3. CTC Matters   Bob Williams, Mike Day and Gary Fergus (Brobeck)

4. FERC Matters    Regulatory and Richard Sanders and Dan Watkiss (Bracewell 
& Patterson)

5. Government Investigations Regulatory and Richard Sanders

 Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs will have overall responsibility for 
coordination of the litigation.  

FYI:  I listened in on the analyst call.  Bryson made it very clear that, 
under the agreement, Edison would re-assume the procurement role on 12.31.02 
and would "administer" (i.e., takeover) the DWR contracts.  Seems pretty 
clear that the State is actively looking for a strategy to exit the 
procurement role.

Jeff

Not sure if you had seen this information.  Looks like if the SCE deal is 
approved, SCE would assume CDWR contracts.   
Jim

Robert Neustaedter@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
04/10/2001 02:21 PM
SCE held a conference call this morning to discuss the  Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) related to the sale of its transmission assets with 
members of the investment community.  After a  brief description of major 
provisions of the MOU, questions were taken.  Following is a summary of that 
call.

Major Components of Plan (repeatedly referred to as the "Governor's Plan")

Maintains cost-of-service treatment for utility retained generation for 10 
years
Sale of transmission assets (or other assets) to CDWR
Dedication of the "Sunrise" generation project to cost-of-service based rates 
for 10 years ($2 mm penalty if not on-line by August)
Provision of easements and potential conveyances in fee of certain lands (at 
two hydro projects)
Provides for full recovery of $3.5 B utility net underrecovery as of 1/31/01
Commits SCE to spend $3 B in capital expenditures over 5 years
Dismissal of federal lawsuits by SCE
SCE will resume traditional utility procurement obligations by 1/1/03, 
assuming CDWR contracts and entering into new purchase contracts as necessary

It was stressed that the MOU was a comprehensive plan to be treated as an 
integrated package.  While the CPUC and members of the legislature were 
involved in various stages of the negotiation, the agreement is technically 
between SCE and CDWR.  Various regulatory and legislative approvals are 
necessary for implementation of the MOU.  SCE has rights to terminate the MOU 
if the CPUC  has not adopted specified "implementing decisions" within 60 
days.  Legislation necessary to implement certain provisions of the MOU must 
be passed by August 15.

For ratemaking purposes the CPUC will grant SCE a 11.6% ROE on its generation 
and distribution rate base.

Questions and Answers

What was expected timing of return to investment grade for SCE?
Up to the rating agencies.  Many steps to go through.  It is assumed agencies 
will be following closely but timing is uncertain.  Would have to be before 
utility resumes power procurement obligations.

Applicability of 11.6% ROE?
ROE would increase from current 7% ROE to level no less than 11.6% for both 
generation and distribution assets on unamortized balance at 12/31/00 and 
capital structure roughly at 50/50.

Potential for write-offs?
While plan calls for full recovery of net undercollections as of 1/31/01, 
because of timing issues SCE may take a write-off then have a "write-up" at a 
later date.

Interest in how/why/impact of inclusion of Mission Sunrise generation project 
(investor concern over market v. regulated returns)?
The state was looking at all options for long-term power contracts.  Market 
returns traded for security of long-term contract.

What will be source for $3 b capital investments over next 5 years?
Capital would come from retained earnings, borrowing and additional 
investments from holding company.

Concern over ability of existing rate level (and "waterfall" disbursement) to 
recover all costs especially if CDWR procurement costs increase?
 Existing rates should cover all costs.  Provisions in MOU allow adjustment 
to rates to maintain investment grade status.

What was gained from MOU as opposed to pursuit through the courts?
Speed and certainty with respect to resolution of outstanding issues. 

Will the sale be a taxable event?
Yes.

What is the URG unit cost?
$.042 per kwH.

In 2003 would SCE have ability to replace contracts of CDWR (when SCE resumes 
procurement role)?
SCE would have ability to enter into new contracts, but would not ignore 
obligations under CDWR contracts.  New contracts would be subject to PUC 
prudence review.  SCE would file procurement plan with the PUC.

You're point?

Sorry, been on calls.  Just got your message.  From my perspective, you got 
it exactly right in the note.  If you have any additional questions, just 
holler.

I get so worked up over this issue...  I really think now is the time to 
speak up and dissent.  Skilling told us at a floor meeting that as an 
organization we've made poor decisions in the past, and he believes it's 
because the people who disagreed with those decisions never spoke up.  So 
help me out! 

Amen.

Ralph:

Thanks.  Really looking forward to discussing further.  The proposal is very 
promising.  As you can imagine, Enron's going to have two concerns:  1) 
ensuring that eligibility for participating in the competition is as broad as 
possible (paragraph #1), and 2) ensuring that the "terms specified by the 
Commission that will ptrotect the regulated service and its other customers 
from financial harm" don't unintentionally (or otherwise) have the effect of 
killing direct access (like AB 1890 did).

Appreciate you sharing this.  You can count on Enron's support.  (Though I 
understand that Enron's support these days is not the most sought after 
commodity---I leave that up to your judgment.  We'll be prepared to help in 
away way you see fit.)

Have a nice weekend.

Jeff

thanks for looking.  when you leaving?  congratz on being the spokesperson.  
if you ever want to compare notes, just let me know.

FEA's asking for a uniform percentage increase on top of existing rate 
allocation structure.

CLFP proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial
and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by Pacific Gas
and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company.

 CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak,
peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current
summer on-peak period for both utilities.  The 3-hour period would be
selected by the customer.  Specifically:

 Service Eligibility:  Customers served as medium or large
commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered
accordingly.  Examples - PG&E's E-19, E-20, etc. and SCE's TOU-8, etc.

 Customer Eligibility:  Electric customers processing, handling,
distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.  (As
noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission
may consider opening the option to others.)

 Customer Charge Surcharge:  A surcharge of $130 per meter per month
for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for
changes to billing procedures.  In the case of optimal billing period
service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period.

 Optional Summer On-Peak Period:  Any continuous 3-hour period during
the summer-on-peak period of time.  Hours may be designated by the customer
consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering
capability.

 The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture
commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many
factors involved in load shedding.  Labor, harvesting schedules and
coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc.
All bear upon such an effort.

 Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service:  Energy rates for
the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for
summer-on-peak energy.  The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would
be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality.
In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the
non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to
retain revenue neutrality.  These rates would apply, as now, workdays of
Monday - Friday.

 Notice and Service:  An eligible customer must notify the utility in
writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account
representative and the customer billing department of the request for
optional summer-on-peak period service.  The 3-hour period of optional
service and the start date for such service shall be specified.  Start dates
should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice
prior to such cycle.  Optional optimal billing period customers would be
treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice.

 Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.  It appears the
number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by
optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the
total number of meters of the utilities.  

 In response to CLFP's data request by PG&E and SCE (attached) the
following is observed.

 For SCE, SIC 20 (food and kindred products) customers account for
approximately 163 meters out of about 10,000 meters.  Of the 163, all but 8
can be managed locally by the Customer Data Acquisition System.  The 8 would
appear to require a field visit.

 For PG&E, out of 11,675 TOU meters on E-19 and E-20 service, 354 or
3% of the total are SIC 20.  Of the 354 nearly half, 175, are hourly
interval meters.  The remaining 179 presumably would need a field visit for
reprogramming.  

 Conclusion:  Based upon the data supplied, metering and billing
changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors
of perishable commodities, there does not seem, in CLFP's opinion, to be a
significant barrier to establishing the program.

This is unreal.  If TW ain't on the A list, who is?

I'll look at it and get back to you first thing Monday.  

I'll be getting you stuff tonite or tomorrow.

Jeff

Dudes:
Here's my my comments to Mark's answers to the questions, and suggestions to 
Jimmie's model.  I don't answer the bottom line question, since we have some 
talking to do on the model.  

Jimmie, your model is great except we have to value the company on cash flow 
(as opposed to NI).  I've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow 
model.  All my stuff is highlighted in yellow.  

It's the capex that's screwy (see assumptions given in questions).  I get at 
25% of 1995 revs, not 45.8% as indicated in the assumptions.  

I also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero, we don't factor 
those balance sheet line items into the DCF model.  Others agree?  

Anyway, it gives me a $3.32 share value, so I think the model's got some 
work.  Take a look and let me know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

Guess I was lazier still.  Agree with your assessment, I just neglected to 
recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash 
flows high enough to justify $14 and $28.  31% and 40% growth rates are (I 
would argue) wildly unrealistic.  In addition, the capex numbers would 
(presumably) have to bump up substantially in order to get you there.  
Therefore, I would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $28 
price (though "irrational exuberance" may permit Netscape to pull it off).  
Unless other folks have comments on the model, I think you're good to go for 
the memo.  Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft.  Great job on the 
case.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

	JcjCal02@aol.com
	04/14/2001 11:16 PM
		 
Jeff,
You're obviously right about discounting cash flow.  I was getting a little 
lazy.  The capital exp in Exhibit 3 in the book is close to what you have in 
the model.  I agree about your working capital assumption.  I guess I'm not 
clear on your conclusion. The $3+ you calculated a share is based on 16% 
growth.  We are being asked to calculate what growth justifies $28/share.  I 
calculate 31% growth for $14/share and about 40% growth for $28 per share.  
Reality is their immediate growth is probably going to be higher than both 
numbers but would not be sustainable for 10 years.

Anyway while we bat this around, I've begun putting some bullshit into the 
memo.  I guess I vote we double the price.  The other IPO in Exhibit 6 
(especially Uunet) demonstrate how hot the high tech IPO market is.  IPOs are 
a lot about emotion and maybe a little about cash flow.  What's the down side 
if the offering doesn't sell well.  Netscape has a very hot business they 
should extract a high price for the potential gold mind they offer (this is 
my 1999 thinking, not 2000).  Comments?

Good morning Jeff,

Perhaps you could help me with something.  Our DSL provider, in an
effort to eliminate SPAM, has decided to limit group e-mails to 25
recipients or less.  My Enron list is considerably longer.  Based on a
previous e-mail, could you please give me an idea as to who I can
eliminate?  I've never heard of many people on the current list.

Thank you.

Scott

Harry:  

At the meeting yesterday, we concluded that it would be a good idea to take 
the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with EES and use it 
as the "base case" to start running the numbers.  Idea being that before we 
shop anything around, we need to know what the numbers look like to determine 
whether the thing's got any legs.  

Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case  numbers shake out, 
we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the 
variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial 
groups for buy-in.  We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger 
Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look 
like by middle of next week.  How's this plan sound?  Few other points:

We assume that bullet 6's reference to "net" means that the deferral is 
calculated by taking any "overcollections" and subtracting them from any 
"undercollections" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year.
What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date?  We're assuming it's 
commercially driven.  We correct?  If so, what's the driver?  Same goes for 
the 2004 ending date.
Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an "Option 2" 
for folks to consider.  (Though we don't think that any numbers need to be 
run on "Option 2" until after having completed the analysis on option 1, 
since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct).  
Option 2 would:
Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking 
treatment.
Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers "noncore," similar to the gas model in 
California, and force those customers to choose an ESP.
Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining "core" 
(i.e., rez and small commercial) customers.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that 
I want to throw out for folks to react to:

Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down 
and simple as possible. 
When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the 
over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation?
In option 2, by adding the "noncore" feature, and by implementing that 
feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the 
proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the 
utility's position).  This is not to say that the complications can't be 
worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to 
highlight it for folks to consider.

Attached is the original, with just a couple of minor edits, and "Option 2."

Best,
Jeff

OK folks.  It's about 80% of the way there.  My brains are oozing out looking 
at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on refining 
assumptions and other folks can examine as well.  I'll continue to check it 
and de-bug it.  Mark, you and I should talk, too.  (You'll note that at this 
point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to do.)  Apologies in 
advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there).

If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know.  

I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to 
start getting the power point presentation together.  And perhaps we should 
think about meeting this weekend?

In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) 
stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios, including 
Dupont, for OAT.

Does this work for folks?  Other thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

These slides look very good and good to go from my perspective.  I have no 
comments.

Apologies.  My dead just fell into a million pieces.  I won't have a chance 
to review Jimmie's fine work (nice name for the CFO, by the way), and I've 
just been informed that I'll need to have dinner with our bankruptcy guy this 
evening (turns out we're on the unsecured creditor committee for PG&E's 
banckruptcy).  So I won't be able to be in class tonite.  Again apologies.  
Great job Jimmie, particularly in light of the Easter holiday.

We'll be at the party, Overture, or no Overture.

The Squaw thing ain't a problem.  No worries.  But let's settle soon.  My 
accounts are a little wacky these days---I'll explain later.  Thanks for 
letting me know.

With the playing, there's a lot of little issues that I think are no big 
deal, but from our weekend at Squaw, it seems that there are some major 
fucking huge issues that you and the mighty C needed to work out.  If you've 
got those worked out, then I'm all fer playing again, though the next 2-3 
weeks are pretty fucking ugly.

All,

I hope you guys can come this Friday to the dinner party at Sarah's house. 
It will be the four of us, Kent, Allison, Bobby, Sarah, and one of Sarah's 
friends called Mari, who was at the post-Hillman rock party. (Riddles is in 
La Paz, Mexico, being the smart guy that he is.) I have conceptualized the 
menu personally--hopefully Cameron and Sarah can carry it out. Also, I think 
there'll be a case of Overture. If that doesn't entice you, I don't know 
what will. I would really love it if you guys could be there. 31 is no big 
deal beyond an excuse to get dead fucked up...

I also checked into the Squaw fiasco, and I hate to report that all that was 
charged to my card was a measly $24.61. So, we'll have to discuss the 
settling of that bill. Sorry for the inconvenience, Jeff.

At the risk of sounding too much like Nancy... I think it would be nice if 
we could try to play music again. I picked up the damn mandolin so that I 
could actually play, not just practice in my room all alone! I know that 
there are many issues that arise between all of us, but maybe we can talk 
about them individually and together, and then try to simply be more mellow, 
have more fun. That doesn't mean that we can't "practice;"  however 
everything must be done in the spirit of enjoyment. All this is pretty 
obvious to all of us, and I don't need any of you to address this issue in 
e-mail, but we've had a lot of good times playing together, and I would like 
us to rise above this and move ahead, and perhaps get to a better place. 
After all, summer is on the way, and we want to be able to impress our 
teachers and mentors. I think of poor Bridget having to sit through the same 
show we gave her last year. What will she say to Ed!? If not, the sidekicks 
are going to have to go on tour.

I love you all and hope this finds you well,

Scotty

Prentice and I talked.  She's going to come back from the sports gig for the 
dinner party.  Don't worry to much about the ganged-up-on-thing---Prentice is 
cool.  She's ready to play.  She and I have been playing together (though our 
respective repertoires, as designed by Avram, diverge more than they 
converge).  We're getting pretty hot on Earl's breakdown, though.

P.S. Comes a point in one's life (like, when you're an adult), that you take 
personal responsibility for your actions---"my dad made me do it" must simply 
give way.  And "my dad made me an exquisite perfectionist" must REALLY really 
give way.

Thanks for the nice e-mail.

I hope you can make the party. Cameron just told me that Prentice has some 
sports thing happening; hopefully Friday's activities aren't too pressing.

As far as the music, Cameron is going to try to shed that Nazi side of her 
that has been sort of instilled in her from her dad (or she attributes it to 
her dad and his perfectionist stance towards music). On the other hand, I am 
too sensitive to her, so we're both going to try to be very aware of both 
those things. We've talked about it and realize that we're going to have to 
get over it in order to enjoy the music. I think if she's more mellow, then 
maybe Prentice won't feel so ganged up on? I hope not, anyway.

Just give us the total for Squaw, and we'll cut you a check.

See you this week,

Scott

As you know, the SVMG Energy Committee plans to discuss variable pricing,
specifically Severin Borenstein's proposal, at its next meeting on Monday. A
copy of his proposal is attached. As I indicated at last week's meeting, I
believe the SVMG should consider endorsing the proposal, with certain
conditions, for the following reasons:

- It provides the broadest, most transparent incentive to reduce consumption
precisely during hours of shortage, thereby reducing the chances of
involuntary curtailments (blackouts).

- It creates a demand response to high prices, thereby reducing the market
power enjoyed by power sellers. This may be one of the only factors
contributing to a more reasonable, stable wholesale price environment if
there is no federal intervention.

- It offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce
their demand overall or shift their demand to off-peak periods.

The following is a "strawman" draft of an endorsement by SVMG for discussion
Monday. I would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of
whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be
interruptible, an issue of concern to some. Also, I hope to have additional
input from Barbara Barkovich before Monday's meeting.

Thanks.

Peter Evans

____________________________

Power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand
during specific hours of supply shortage (and high prices). This gives the
greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a
staggering DWR bill and suffering through frequent blackouts. Getting people
to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market
power of sellers. We therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above
historical levels (and rebate for power use reductions below historical
levels) at the real-time energy price.

Our support for this concept includes the following conditions:

1. Historical consumption levels, which would be served under regulated
rates, would be based on last year's use, taking into account the customer's
historical load profile. Adjustments would be made for increases/decreases
in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to
account for changes in business volume. Historical consumption served
under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio (say 75% to 95%) to build
in some expectation of conservation.

2. Participation

All customer classes would participate. In the absence of real time load
data (i.e. residential customers), monthly consumption deviations from
historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price.

3. Alternatives for Above-Baseline Use

It must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered
ability to procure power for their above-historical power requirements on
their own if they choose to. This could include self-generation, bilateral
forward purchases, or purchasing at the spot price from the DWR.

4. Sunset

This approach should automatically terminate at the end of 2001, requiring
government or regulatory action to extend it.

Our schedules make it messy.  I can come over tomorrow during the break if 
Anil and Carolyn want to meet.  Mark, if you want to hunker down with the 
model tomorrow, you should feel free.  The only thing about Thursday is that 
Carolyn's got a commitment with Dian.  Can we talk about meeting this 
weekend?  I can be flexible.

OK folks. It's about 80% of the way there. My brains are oozing out
looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on
refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well. I'll continue to
check it and de-bug it. Mark, you and I should talk, too. (You'll note
that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to do.)
Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there).

If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know.

I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to
start getting the power point presentation together. And perhaps we should
think about meeting this weekend?

In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire
Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios,
including Dupont, for OAT.

Does this work for folks? Other thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

_______________________________________________

Date: April 18, 2001 - 

A source with California State Senator Debra Bowen's (D) office says Gov. 
Gray Davis' (D) tentative agreement to buy Southern California Edison's (SCE) 
transmission assets will face tough scrutiny from suspicious lawmakers who do 
not believe it is in the best interest of ratepayers. State regulators are 
also expressing concern about the deal and consumer advocates are predicting 
its demise.

"There are two alternatives," says the Bowen source. "Lawmakers will either 
fashion a better deal or allow SCE to work out their problems in bankruptcy 
court." 

Bowen is the chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications 
Committee.

The deal calls for SCE to sell its transmission assets to the state 
Department of Water Resources (DWR) for 2.3 times its book value or $2.76 
billion. The agreement also calls for the California Public Utilities 
Commission (PUC) to establish a rate plan so that $3.5 billion of debt could 
be recovered by SCE for its power purchases before the state began buying 
electricity in January. 

"This is the single most important cash flow provision of the memorandum of 
understanding," says a source with the state Office of Ratepayer Advocate 
(ORA). "SCE will collect all of the costs they have incurred." ORA had argued 
against bailing SCE out of debt saying its parent company had ample funds.

In return for the premium paid in excess of the value of its transmission 
assets, SCE has agreed to sell the output of its generating plants at 
cost-based rates.

"Because of the premium, cost-based rates should be lower," says the ORA 
source.

"The senator is very skeptical," says the Bowen source. "The deal is a great 
benefit for generators and utilities but little, if any, benefit for 
ratepayers."

The source says there is also concern with the SCE deal because it will only 
involve about a third of the 32,000 miles of transmission lines in the state.

"If you buy a third of a bridge don't you wind up getting wet" asks the Bowen 
source. 

Davis has expressed optimism that the state will eventually obtain all of the 
state's utility transmission lines. Pacific Gas & Electric's (PG&E) 
bankruptcy filing has complicated the governor's plan, but Davis says the 
state can now obtain the assets through the courts. However, the state must 
now compete with private companies intent on the same thing. Negotiations 
between the state and San Diego Gas & Electric are continuing.

The Bowen source says provisions in the deal which fashion a way for 
generators to collect all they are owed by SCE is also of concern to 
lawmakers.

"The state's position was that the rates charged by generators were unjust 
and unreasonable," says the source. "If you now pay the generators you have, 
at the very least, a public relations problem."

The source says there may also be a court fight over the issue.

"The creditors dealing with PG&E in bankruptcy court would probably want the 
same treatment," says the source. "This creates an intriguing whipsaw effect."

A bill outlining the terms of the agreement between the state must be 
introduced before official consideration begins in the legislature. 

A source with UCAN says a bill based on the present agreement will never be 
passed.

"If it survives, it will be modified," says the source.

I plan to be booting everyone out of my house before/upon my return from the
airport, if you catch my drift, but perhaps we can place some people in Amy
Hood's upstairs abode to slave away?  Or you can just come at 5:30 or 6?
I've told people to come at 7:30, I think, but I am pretty flexible on that.

Amy Hood will provide salad plates, and I think my regular dinner plates are
big enough to fit pasta and steak/potatoes/radish salad (which is really a
garnish anyway).  Does that work?

I think it all sounds great.  I can probably be at your house around 2pm or
so.  It looks like you might be off to the airport, but we can coordinate
and hopefully someone else might be around.  I can make the dressing on
Thursday night.  I would also be happy to make anything on Thursday that I
can.  I'll look at the recipes tonight and let you know what I can do ahead
of time.

The only thing missing that the birthday boy requested is truffle pasta (and
Jeff this is where you come in).  This might be very easy and if it is I
will take care of it and serve it before the steaks.  If I can do it then
you might even drop an appetizer (or we'll never get to the cake).  Jeff,
can you help me with this pasta?  Essentially he wants a light truffle pasta
like we had everywhere in Tuscany.  We have those truffles in jars - any
idea what to do with them.  We also have truffle oil.  If all else fails, I
am prepared to cook some fettuccini, slice up one of a truffles, mix in some
olive oil and truffle oil and toss.  What do you think??

What time are we tell the non-preparers to come??

Chicks,

Friday approaches.  Alison has graciously volunteered to deal with flowers,
and Amy H is going to make a cake.  Here is my suggested menu:

Champagne/wine/cocktails (I have)
Savory biscotti to dip into medium-bodied red wine (from Martha Stewart)
Smoked salmon nori stacks (from Martha Stewart)
Moroccan salmon on bamboo skewers (from Martha Stewart)
Fancy-looking crudites presented nicely in glasses and whatnot with
buttermilk dip (from Martha Stewart) 
Iceberg wedges with roquefort dressing (Cameron's mom's recipe)
Steak with wasabi mashed potatoes and daikon radish salad (April 2001 Bon
Appetit)
Cake (Amy)
Port/champagne/etc (I have some)

I am going to go to the grocery store on Thurs afternoon and could
potentially make the biscotti then.  I have picked things that I think will
look impressive but not be impossible to get done (a) relatively quickly and
(b) ahead of time.  I think the mashed potatoes can also be done ahead of
time.

I may have a conference call on Fri from 9-11, but I hope to put it on mute
while I chop things.  I will have to do some work and also pick up Bob at
the airport at 2:30, but any help is welcomed (either in person or on your
own separately).  Let me know what your plan is and what you'd be interested
in doing, as well as any questions or concerns you have about le menu.  

This will be soooooooo fun!

FYI.  The agenda for the legislative oversight committee's gas hearing 
tomorrow includes two Brattle Group consultants, Paul Carpenter and Matt 
O'Loughlin. They will make up the first panel, titled, "California's High 
Natural Gas Prices: Market Power and Other Factors."

In California's gas wars, Edison hired these folks--Carpenter in particular-- 
to show that SoCalGas has considerable market power in California and abuses 
it.  (Edison was a long-time, very unhappy gas customer of SoCalGas', until 
it sold off its power plants.  The animosity remains, however.)  Should be 
interesting to see where the committe goes with that panel.

CA PUC lawyer, Harvey Morris, is the sole witness on the second panel.  
Harvey is zealous in his assertions regarding market power in interestate 
markets serving California and is the PUC's lead attorney on such matters at 
FERC.

I plan on attending the hearing.

It's likely that I will also be attending a hearing on price caps at CMA's 
offices in the afternoon.

Best,
Jeff

I'll actually be in Sacramento tomorrow (need to hear the hub-bub at the gas

positive change.  Reflection and realization are powerful things.

I'll bring all the paperwork over tonite.  We can go over it then.  It 
actually adds up, as far as I can tell.  It was fun as hell, but it sure 
weren't cheap.

Best,
Jeff

You're right on, what you said yesterday about Cameron's taking 
responsibility for herself, instead of passing off the blame. But, that's 
exactly why this whole thing has been good for Cameron. She sees this part 
of her that isn't fair or compassionate, and really wants to change it. 
Pinning it on her father only makes her see clearly that it isn't healthy. 
Half the battle is realizing that these are patterns instilled from sources 
outside, things she needs to correct, and then move away from. We all go 
through that very difficult process. "Blame" needs to arise before one can 
move beyond into a better place. I think we'll all see her try to be better 
than she's been.

As for the bill, don't you think that's high? One night, the dinner, 
Cameron's rental, and lift tickets should come to about $500, no? How much 
was your half? Did they provide you with a break-down of the charges? I 
don't mean to be a pain, but I don't really trust their methods after this 
debacle.

Cheers,

Scott

Thank you for your note.  There was a little timing issue of when the email

of moving code now and it should be up within the half hour.  I'm hoping 
you'll enjoy the application.  Let us know your thoughts.  Thanks.

congratulations on being "re-commissioned."

What time do you get home from school.  If it's before 5 could you stop by 
the Theater on the Square box office and get tickets?  Cameron said that she 
and Scott want tickets, too.  It's going to sell out (if it ain't already 
sold out), so we should probably do it quickly.

I love you.

Hi, all---
You may already know this, but I wanted to keep you updated.  All new 
commodity (power) business in California has been put on hold.  Yesterday, 
Eric Letke announced to the team of originators that we would be suspending 
new efforts until the regulatory/legislative environment is more solid in 
California.  

With that news, all of our team meetings and conference calls have been 
cancelled.

However, I want to maintain a weekly call (30 min max) on our own....just to 
keep-in-touch. 
I will defer to your schedules.  
Please tell me what day and hour looks best for you.  
OR
Is there an existing call that we could join?
I just don't want to lose focus.

Participants:
Regulatory Affairs (Harry, Jeff, Sue, Robert)
Market Development (Marcus Dotson, Jennifer Rudolph, Ed Hamb)

Thank you!

Shoot.  Remember that I asked many moons ago if you wanted the tickets?  I 
thought you said no.  So I let it go.  Now they've all been snatched up.  But 
I'll see if if those folks are still planning on going.  I think that chances

any chance of getting tickets for any of the Cubs games - 4/27, 4/28, 4/29?
I have 2 each for the 27th and 28th - but I know Eldon would like to go with
more than one person.  I have 4 for Sunday - and I think Cameron and Scott
and Eldon and I are going to that one - but it would be fun to have more
attendees.  He especially wanted Rory and Timmi etc. to come on Saturday I
think - anyway just a thought...

Proposal to Alleviate California=01,s Electricity Shortage
Through Incentives to Reduce Demand

Objective
=06=15 Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in=20
anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand

Proposal
=06=15 The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately condu=
ct=20
on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs
=06=15 Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down=
=20
program.  However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authori=
ty=20
to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direc=

the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediate=
ly.

The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program)
=06=15 Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reduct=

they chose not to accept them=20
=06=15 Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continue=

payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone d=

to demand reductions

A Single Price Approach
=06=15 A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key=20
disadvantages:
=06=15 First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser =
price=20
will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC=
=20
overpaid lower cost generators.  The state would overpay for reduced demand=
=20
under the single price approach.
=06=15 Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=
s.
=06=15 Further, the single price approach does not provide greater certaint=
y=20
regarding the cost of demand reductions.  By conducting an auction the stat=
e=20
will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis, starting with=
=20
the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to t=
he=20
cost the state is willing to pay.
=06=15 A single price approach, however, could work if targeted at customer=
s who=20
would not participate in an auction, i.e. residential customers.  A well=20
publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than la=
st=20
year would further reduce demand in the state.  Thus the auction and the=20
single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion.
=06=15 The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consume=

=06=15 If the utilities implement the program, the California PUC would inc=

Hazards to Avoid
=06=15 Avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or PUC review to delay implementa=

the reductions
_ Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to=

achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer 2001
_ There are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction=20

_ The utility should immediately contract for on-line services and present=

the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval
_ The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple,=

I got a voicemail fro Ken.  He would be happy to meet with Freeman.  He is 
willing to work on other times, but suggested the following
After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day 
before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to 
cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing 
to do this if necessary)
His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early 
morning on the third.
Jeff -- could you coordinate with Rosie to get the time and place nailed down?

Crudely put (my apologies), I think it goes something like, "don't sacrifice

Yes,

It had by shipper, by contract level info.  -- the type of info available on 
our transactional reports.  There is a protective order in place in the 
proceeding, so I don't believe the information is generally available.  We 
did not ask for confidential treatment -- but we did excise rate information 
for periods prior to Sept. 2000 (the date that this info started appearing on 
our transactional reports).

Shelley, how detailed was the information provided?  Was it broken down by 
shipper?  Also, did you request confidential treatment?  

FYI 

Judge Wagner issued a subpoena to Transwestern and several other pipelines in 
the referenced proceeding at SoCal Edison's request.  The request sought 
information on scheduled, actual and contracts quantities to the California 
border for the time period 1997 to present.  While we are not a party in the 
case, we decided to cooperate in the proceeding and not file a motion to 
quash.  We responded yesterday. 

Shoot.  I'm sorry.  Is this what you called to discuss?  I'm here.  (with a 
"need yesterday" assignment from Steve).  Give me a call at 415.782.7822.

As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

Greetings:
Look forward to it.  I've just had two "need them yesterday" requests that I 
need to complete today.  Are you available tomorow to discuss further?

Jeff,

My name is Kurt Lindahl.  I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG 
team.  I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with 
building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast.  Michael McGarry, 
from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead 
Development Engineer on the project.

A key question in this effort is, "Where is the best entry point into the 
Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems.  In other words, where can we site a LNG 
terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of 
facilities they require is minimal?  I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the 
optimization department in ETS.  He said that if we could get annual flow 
diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in 
about 2 weeks time.  Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams 
at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the 
CPUC?  That's where I need your help.  This is a hot subject, because the 
race to site an LNG terminal is intense.

Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can 
discuss.  We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain 
secrecy.

I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals.

Regards,

Kurt Lindahl

Karen:
See highlited section of story below.  PG&E's got it right.  Recall that DWR 
was only buying power that it determined was "priced reasonably."  
Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.  That meant that the 
ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.  The ISO would 
then charge the utilities for the power purchased.  Recall that Bob Glynn 
referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance 
sheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy.  
Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net 
short, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.  So it's 
therefore no surprise that the State's daily bill for power purchases has 
increased dramatically---just not for any of the bogus reasons cited by 
Governor Backbone.

Jeff

FYI.  Ray

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : April 20, 2001
CA Governor, Regulators Push on, but Legislature Raises Doubts 
Two certainties prevailed in California's blighted energy landscape Thursday: 
wholesale power bills are getting bigger and state regulators are trying 
harder to salvage Gov. Gray Davis' deal with Southern California Edison Co. 
But in the state legislature from which the ultimate solutions must come 
there was growing skepticism, despite a series of meetings with the governor 
earlier in the week. 
While nervousness over the state's electricity bill and the prospect of 
insufficient power supplies this summer prevailed, Davis met with 25 members 
of California's congressional delegation at a Los Angeles airport hotel to 
press his case for federal actions to resolve the seemingly endless energy 
dilemma. 
The California Public Utilities Commission has ordered a statewide 
investigation of the contractual obligations of the almost 700 small 
(qualifying facility) QF generators toward the utilities, but most of the 
five-member commission's activity was focused outside its regular business 
meeting in San Francisco. CPUC President Loretta Lynch offered empathy toward 
Edison's financial plight and renewed pleas for federal regulators to provide 
wholesale price relief. 
"I have committed that the CPUC will expeditiously review those provisions of 
(Edison's proposed agreement) that require CPUC resolution, and I have taken 
steps to begin that process," Lynch said in a prepared statement released 
Wednesday. "In the meantime, I commit to reviewing on a priority basis any 
and all proposals that promote the financial health of California utilities 
and the interests of its consumers." 
Davis and some of the CPUC commissioners have been complaining that the cost 
of the state's daily purchases of wholesale power on the spot market have 
increased from about $50 million to more than $70 million daily since the 
April 6 bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but the utility 
challenged the conclusion that the court filing caused the latest price 
increases. 
"While it is understandable, even laudable, that the governor would want to 
fully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not 
accurate," said PG&E utility spokesperson John Nelson. He argued that the 
increase in state payments for power reflect that the state water resources 
department (DWR) now is covering all spot purchases, including the often 
costly real-time emergency purchases by the state's transmission grid 
operator, Cal-ISO. 
Thus, PG&E's spokesperson said the more likely cause of the increased power 
bill lies with recent moves by federal regulators and Cal-ISO, noting that 
the state grid operator should only sell to "creditworthy" entities. These 
moves were done independent of the PG&E bankruptcy filing, Nelson said. 
As the daily bill for power goes up, draining the state treasury more 
quickly, pressure mounts for a resolution to the utility financial situation. 
But the legislature has expressed skepticism toward the governor's proposed 
deal with Edison. State Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) told news 
media Wednesday that bankruptcy might be the best approach for Edison. 
In adopting the new investigations of QF generators, the CPUC's commissioners 
acknowledged that eventually the issue of back payments to the small 
generators needs to be addressed, particularly to a group representing up to 
3,000 MW collectively.

We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that 
the Px credit should be based on DJ-NP15 and DJ-SP15 rather than the defunct 
Px because AB1890 requires it to be based on market (not costs).  Changing to 
procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB1890 which requires DA 
customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers.  
And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJ-NP15/SP15, that is the only 
appropriate available method.  

Further, the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA 
customers should be charged the generation surcharges ($10 +$30).  DA 
customers should be given market based Px credits (based on DJNP15/SP15) 
because its the law.  There are 2 possible interpretations resulting from the 
combination of AB1890 and the new law.  
The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any 
surcharge.
The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the $30 + $10 
surcharges
Interpretation 1 results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other 
customers.  It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent.
Interpretation 2 results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other 
customers until the end of AB1890.  This seems like the likely interpretation 
since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB1890.  Thus given 
that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus $40, 
they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the 
rate freeze ends.

Once the Px credit ends (Mar 2002), the surcharge should end because the law 
(AB1890) no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because:
Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the 
utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should 
not be charged for them.

In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value (if the courts 
interpret the law differently than Enron) then there should be no generation 
surcharge for DA customers.

This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting

As you are aware, SCE made an advice filing on April 5th to eradicate the PX
Rate Schedule and Replace it with Schedule PE --Procured Energy.  As part of
the filing, SCE proposes to set "on an interim basis" the cost of energy
procurement, for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the
calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the
Generation rate component of the Customer's otherwise applicable tariff.

Two primary issues arise from SCE's statement. First what does "interim
basis" mean -- how long will this be in effect.  In starts on January 19th,
but it is unclear as to when it would end. Second, and most important. is
what is meant by the Generation rate component.  While there is not much
explanation in the April 5 advice letter, in a subsequent advice letter
filed on April 11 (1533-E), SCE set forth "Rate Schedule Specific Generation
Related Rates" which range between five and nine cents.

I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier.  We need
to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday, April 25th.  All
thoughts on the matter are welcome.

Jeanne:  here is a revised stip that incorporates your requested language
regarding parties' rights to contest the advice filing.  I couldn't get the
track changes to work accurately so I will just tell you there are not
changes except for your paragraph which is the fourth from the last in the

STRANGOZZI WITH BLACK TRUFFLE
Ingredients (4 people): 
500 g of fresh hand-made strangozze, 150 g of black valuable truffle, 
extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, sat, black pepper and parsley. br> 
Preparation: 
Fry slightly the extra-virgin oil, the garlic and some parsley. Take the pan 
off from the stove, filter the spices and mix the other oil with the grated 
truffle seasoned with salt and black pepper. The pasta must be "al dente". 
Pour the sauce on the pasta and mix it on the stove at light heat for a 
while, then serve it guarnished with truffles slices. 

		The TRUFFLE
history of a typical umbrian product 

For a lot of people, the word truffle recalls a tuberous entity, marbled on 
the skin, with a nice scent, tasting delicious and it is usually associated 
to a good lunch, generously wet by sweet wine; for the botanics, instead, 
this is just the fruit spreading device of mushrooms wich adapted living in 
the underground. 
Since from the beginning truffles interested philosophers and scientists, 
starting fighting and discussions to whom neither very strict thinkers like 
Savonarola could avoid to partecipate. 
It is not so strange then that in the first book scientifically talking about 
mushrooms which has been printed, the Opusculus de Tuberis di Alfonso 
Ceccarelli da Bevagna (1564), was about TRUFFLES. Almost 2000 years before 
the Greek philosopher Teophrastus (370-287 a.C.) turned on the discussion 
asserting that truffles were vegetables without roots, originated during 
winter rains, if there were thunders. Strange theory, without doubts. The 
Romans were really crazy for truffles and the Latin poets Apicious and 
Giovenal glorified the truffles and their taste, writing also a recipes book. 
During the middle age it was the king on the refined tables of every king's 
court. In a document from Baron A. Ancaiani (1761) about the "active and 
passive commerce of the town of Spoleto" huge quantities of truffles sent to 
Florence and Venice are described. It seems they were really requested. 
Rossini defined it the Mozart of the kitchen and it is told that Napoleon 
used huge quantities of the truffle to provide a successor to his kingdom. 
About its botanic constitution, instead, until the late 18th century the 
strangest theories continued to be produced. The celeber naturalist Plinio il 
vecchio considered them as they were ground corns and a miracle. 
Bornolz (1780) thought they were an intermediate class between the animal and 
the vegetal kingdoms. Revel, in 1857, said the truffles were the result of a 
fly bite on a oak root. 
Just after the second half of 18th century the idea that the truffles were 
autonomous organisms, or better mushrooms, started to be accepted. Our Umbria 
keeps a rich ipogeous flora and since centuries is the first country in 
producing truffles, especially the valuable black truffle (Tuber melanosporum 
Vitt.) spread around the woods around Norcia and Spoleto. The mushroom has 
always different dimensions and it can vary from the width of a nut to that 
of an orange and it is very appreciated for the intensity of the smell and 
the rich taste. The collecting of the tubers happens during the time between 
December and March. Secondary is, in these same zones, the production of 
white truffle (Tuber Magnatum Pico) foun in Spoleto nearby valleys, but 
impressive is the production of summer "scorzone" truffle (Tuber aestivum 
Vitt.) and even of the "hooked" truffle (Tuber uncinatum Ch?teau), which have 
a peculiar taste and smell. 
what truffles are

With the name truffle are designed mushrooms belonging to the order of 
tuberales (Ascomycetes), because the mushrooms have a vegetal body formed by 
a white mold (micelius), constituted by thousand of very thin filaments 
(ife). This mold lives deep into the ground and it physically unites to the 
roots of several plants, originating a very peculiar symbiosis called 
"micorriza". 
When the ecolocical conditions are fine, the micelius generates the fructifer 
bodies which are formed in a variable range of 40-50 cm. deep in the ground. 
They are tuber-like shaped, or sheroidal or irregular and they are about 1 to 
15 cm. long. The body is made by an internal substance called "gleba" in 
which you can distinguish the fertile zones (darker) which carry the "aschi", 
a peculiar kind of spore, and in which the spores (the vehicles of diffusion 
for this organisms) mature, and the sterile zones (lighter) which surround 
the fertile zones, originating in the most evolved species a characteristic 
venation system. The "gleba" is protected on the outside by a variable 
cortical layer called "peridio", inseparable from the "gleba". The "peridio" 
could have its surface smooth or rough or even warted. The color could be 
white, yellow-like, rusty, brown or blackish. These mushrooms have several 
different species (about 30 in Europe) distributed in all the continents. The 
valuable edible species, however, are very limited. 
chemical composition and nutritive value 

In order to give some information about the nutritive value of this mushroom, 
two species of truffles have been examinated: rtuber melanosporum Vitt._ 
(valuable black truffle from Norcia or Spoleto) and rtuber magnatum Pico_ 
(valuable white truffle from Piemonte or Acqualagna). The valuable black 
truffle has been found in the Quercus Pubescens tartufaia in january. The 
white one has been found close to Citt. di Castello (High Tiber valley) in 
Populus Nigra tartufaia in November. These two different species of truffle 
are not so different about their chemical composition. The proteins are the 
main nutrient component for the metabolism: they are complete and rich, above 
all of lisyn, cystin and metionin, and they are very digestible. Even the 
minaral composition is great. The fat are essentially unsaturated and the 
most important is the linoleic acid. It is pretty relevant the fiber content. 
how to wash truffles

Before you can use truffles, you must gently clean it from the ground with a 
soft brush, in order to eliminate all the ground particles. It is 
suggestible, before starting the operation, to keep them under warm water for 
a couple of minutes. This will help the ground to fall from the space between 
the wrinkles. The skin is edible and it must be ate excactly as the rest of 
the truffle, and it is very aromatic and tasty. 
how to preserve truffles

Once it has been found in a good condition, it is important to process the 
tuber as soon as possible, because it is very easy for it to decay and lose 
its aromatic flavour. The soulution to this problem should be left to the 
specialized companies. Sometimes, however, you must do it by yourself, so 
here are some advice: before all don't remove the ground from the cracks 
because it will just accelerate the decaying process, but roll every truffle 
in a napkin and put it in a can or a jar, in the less cold part of your 
refrigerator. The paper must be changed every day. This procedure will allow 
you to save fresh truffles for about 5-6 days for the white one and for 10 
days the black one. you can even save the truffles in a can containing rice, 
but this is not very smart, because you dry the tuber, taking the air off of 
it and helping the decaying. Another sytem is to deep fry the truffles in the 
oil, obtaining a sauce you can save in the refrigerator for about a month. Or 
you can crush it, if black, or slice it, if white, and then mix it with 
creamy butter and add some salt. Then you shape it as a brick or tube, as you 
like. Every time you would like to add to a dish the truffle aroma, you can 
just add a small flake of this valuable truffled butter, resting in the 
refrigerator. It is better to use the butter within a month from its 
preparation. 
truffles in cuisine
keep always in mind that:
a black truffle must never be grated or crushed in a mortar; 
it must never be cooked or too warm; 
never mix truffle and cheese; 
always use extra-virgin olive oil and salt; 
use it in dishes which are not alredy very flavoured (Ex. with boiled or 
grilled lake fish, with boiled or grilled poultry and so on.) 

Greetings TJ:
Well I'm in a pickle.  The memo you sent said we had from 11:30 AM to 10:00PM 
on 4.19, and from 7 AM to 9 AM on 4.20.  But the documentation I received 
from Telebears said from 1 PM on 4.19 to 1 PM on 4.20.  All that aside, I 
have obviously missed the times, it's my fault, and I apologize.

I spoke with Diane this morning and she suggested that I throw myself at the 
mercy of the court by writing you an email with my picks.  Here they are:

Jeff,

My name is Kurt Lindahl.  I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG 
team.  I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with 
building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast.  Michael McGarry, 
from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead 
Development Engineer on the project.

A key question in this effort is, "Where is the best entry point into the 
Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems.  In other words, where can we site a LNG 
terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of 
facilities they require is minimal?  I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the 
optimization department in ETS.  He said that if we could get annual flow 
diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in 
about 2 weeks time.  Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams 
at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the 
CPUC?  That's where I need your help.  This is a hot subject, because the 
race to site an LNG terminal is intense.

Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can 
discuss.  We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain 
secrecy.

I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals.

Regards,

Kurt Lindahl

I'll read it then call you.

Looks good, Scott.  One thing:  I admit I'm not a lawyer, so someone needs to 
show me the precise language in AB 1890 that 1) requires the credit (which, I 
believe was created by the PUC, not the legislature) to be based on market 
and 2) requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers. 

Mike Day:  Do you concur with Scott's interpretation in AB 1890?

Like your arguments, Scott.  Just want to clarify that we're on solid legal 
ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief and/or protest. 

Best,
Jeff

We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that

Attached is Paul Carpenter (Brattle Group) preliminary findings that 
marketers have market power at the border.

By my second email I'm sending Enron's responses to the pleadings at FERC 
which refute the notion of the need to reinstitute price controls at the 
California border.

Alternatively, a good argument to high gas prices at the CA border is the 
message in Stan's natural gas roundtable speech (i.e. high gas prices can be 
directly attributed to supply/demand factors).

FYI.  Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in 
which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state 
suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any 
questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think 
might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?

RECENT EVENTS:

-- IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos=
t
of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB 28x.  SB 28x
(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many
IEP-sponsored proposals.  As you will recall, two new provisions were added
to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing
with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating
facilities.  Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided
not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision
remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold
their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate
on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that
already have retrofit requirements.  I will be faxing out the agreed upon
language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the
completion of any mandated retrofits.  It does not expand the authority of
the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The
schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such
later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability.

With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be
voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for
concurrence on Tuesday.  The final version will include the following
IEP-sponsored proposals:

? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act
requirements
? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE=
C
? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power
plant sites
? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed
project.
? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency
review.
? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process
established in AB 970.

Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,
IEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  IEP proposals still
on the table include:

? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for
power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance
? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies
? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.
? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements

-- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good=
 news.
The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new
power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited
permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can=
.
Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege.  This
issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to
include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power
plant project.

AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a
developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California
entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee.  IEP
members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure
regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are
definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied.

-- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm=
ents
attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x
(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.  Attached is a copy o=
f
the bill in PDF form.  The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the
Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can=
 be
found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17
(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton
in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most
likely the best we could get.

-- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee=
 to
Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.
This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati=
ons
into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:
Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric
Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State
Auditor.

--  The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and
focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the
committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the
rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and
collusion occurred.  The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o=
f
bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the
committee=01,s hearings over the last two months.  This package will be up =
for
consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee.

-- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the
Calpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th=
e
San Jose region.  The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so
that construction can begin.

-- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week.
IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and
will comment on their provisions as soon as possible.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
of any of these bills.

I nabbed the Co's 4 tickets (not great, but free) for the game against the 
Bums on Wed June 27th.  Starts at 4 PM. Interested.  The Tuesday game's at 
7:30, but thought it'd be nice to see an early game.  Let me know.

Best,
Jeff

You mean I can register in Telebears this Monday from 7 AM to 8 AM?  I have a 
7 AM conference call on Monday, but I'll do my darnedest to register then.  
Thanks for being patient.

Best,
Jeff

Harry: You clearly did a fantastic job, particularly under the circumstances 
described by Leslie.  Thanks a million for your help--we really needed 
it--and you managed to leave with your credibility intact, to boot.

And thanks. too, to Leslie.  The EES piece of the California puzzle is 
extremely challenging (as you know) and your and Harry's efforts are greatly 
appreciated.  I can cover the hearings on Monday and Tuesday.  Thanks again.

Jeff

Bradford's a former career--PUC Commissioner (I think he's now with 
Moskovitz' RAP group).  Severin Borenstein's the UC Berkeley professor who's 
been vocal on wholesale market power and the need for real-time pricing to 
encourage conservation.  Don't know the other consultant fellow.

FYI:  Here's monthly share price date over last five years for:  OAT, KO, 
PEP, S&P, BRKA, BRKB.  (I included Berkshire in the event we want to say 
something about Buffet's recent performance.  I've attached another file with 
a chart that shows Buffet versus S&P for 1, 3 and 5 year performance)  

For the OAT, KO, PEP, etc. file, calculated year-on-year performance 
(excluding dividends).  Also, you'll see highlighted in yellow month-on-month 
performance for 2001.  But ain't done any chart for that stuff yet.  Thought 
we'd discuss first.

Best,
Jeff

Christine:

My apologies.  My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.  Here's 
where folks came out.  There's some concern about size.  We're supposed to be 
no larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Ok'd our 
"oversized" group.  The other folks in the group--who talked to him 
originally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules.  Folks wondered 
if there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up 
with.  Sorry about that---it's a wrinkle that I didn't think about when we 
spoke.  If it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group, let me know.  
Fortunately there's not another team case due for two weeks.

Best,
Jeff

Yes, we have been working with them.  Stephanie and I were asked to meet last 
week with the heads of the California Chamber and the California 
Manufacturer's Association, at which we discussed demand buy down, etc. at 
length.  It was a very positive meeting.  

Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program.  And I 
believe that our folks (Jim?) are meeting with Reliant to discuss it further 
in D.C.  

I can fax you a copy of what they're walking around if you don't have it.  
I'll let others chime in, but seems to me that it would be very useful to 
contact him.

Hey guys.  Are we in communication or working with Reliant in California?  In 
particular, a guy by the name of  John Stout or a woman (I think she's PR) 
named Stephanie Newell?  My understanding is that they are shopping a demand 
exchange idea---in particular in Utah.  I would like to contact him in 
preparation for the RGA meeting in Los Angeles, but wanted to check with you 
all first to see what we might already be doing with them.

Thanks.  Could you please send around the model, too?  I want to use for the 
financials table.

You'll be pleased to know that I registered over the web version of telebears 
this morning.  If there's anything else, please don't hesitate.

No smoking gun in natural-gas cost probe
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published April 23, 2001) 
It strikes at the heart of an energy crisis that has caused 
multibillion-dollar losses and could plunge California's economy into a 
tailspin: Did private companies manipulate markets to get rich off consumers' 
pain? 
An Assembly oversight committee spent hours last week grilling officials of 
El Paso Natural Gas Co. and an affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy, companies 
that were accused by state regulators of anti-competitive practices that 
helped send gas prices soaring. 
Committee Chairman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, said the hearing 
convinced him that El Paso exercised "market power" -- undue influence over 
supply, demand and prices -- even though no smoking gun surfaced in the 
testimony. 
"You have to look at this from a common-sense perspective -- the price spikes 
were astronomical," Steinberg said. "Could they have occurred in such an 
extraordinary fashion absent market manipulation? The answer, to me, clearly 
is no." 
No wrongdoing has yet been proved, however, and El Paso officials contend 
they have acted legally and ethically. 
State regulators have complained to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
that El Paso and its affiliates made it difficult for others to use pipeline 
capacity into California so that El Paso could constrain natural gas supply, 
increase demand and enrich itself in domino-like fashion. 
Attorney Harvey Morris of the state Public Utilities Commission told 
legislators that El Paso improperly sold 40 percent of its California 
pipeline capacity to an affiliate, which set unrealistically high shipping 
prices to discourage use by others and drive up the market. 
"To us, it was pretty obvious what was going on," Morris testified. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate 
pipelines, has dismissed a PUC allegation that El Paso illegally gave 
preference to an affiliated company. But the federal agency has scheduled its 
own hearing into complaints of anti-competitive practices. FERC officials 
declined to testify at the Assembly hearing. 
El Paso executives say gas prices have been affected by weather, storage 
levels and other factors beyond their control, primarily extraordinary demand 
for natural gas needed by power plants to generate electricity. 
"We're not withholding capacity -- no one is," Ralph Eads, president of El 
Paso Merchant Energy, told the oversight panel Thursday. "With these prices, 
you want to sell every molecule." 
The controversy is fueled by records showing that natural gas prices at the 
Southern California border skyrocketed -- far exceeding national averages -- 
soon after El Paso Merchant assumed control of 1.2 billion cubic feet of 
daily pipeline capacity from its corporate parent. 
The El Paso pipeline, one of two key arteries to the state line in Southern 
California, stretches from Texas through New Mexico to the border town of 
Topock in Arizona. 
Prices more than quadrupled at Topock during the one-year period ending in 
March of this year, records show. Much of that rise stemmed from 
transportation rather than production costs. 
By February, prices at Topock had jumped from about $2.59 per million British 
thermal units to $12.69 per million Btu. Nationally, prices had risen from 
about $2.61 per million Btu to just $6 per million Btu in that same period, 
records show. 
But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, a member of the oversight committee, 
warned against using such statistics to conclude that El Paso violated any 
federal pipeline laws or regulations. 
Making money off a crisis is not necessarily illegal, he said. Market 
conditions can place private companies in the catbird's seat, allowing them 
to reap big bucks. Are they obligated -- legally, not morally -- to restrict 
their profits? 
"To make the jump from profiting from a shortage to market manipulation is 
not something that should be done cavalierly," he said. 
The El Paso case is being watched closely by legislators and consumers. 
The PUC says that El Paso's market manipulation will cost California gas and 
electricity customers more than $100 million annually. 
The Brattle Group consulting firm has placed the figure much higher, 
estimating that cost increases for electricity customers of Southern 
California Edison Co. alone totaled about $750 million during the past year. 
El Paso and its affiliates are involved in selling pipeline space to other 
natural gas companies, selling gas themselves at the California border and 
generating alternative sources of electricity whose price is tied to natural 
gas costs. 
Shareholders stood to gain handsomely as gas prices shot upward, according to 
the PUC. 
El Paso Merchant's earnings before interest and taxes rose from $3 million in 
1999 to $563 million in 2000, according to documents filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The report gave no breakdown, however, of profits tied specifically to 
California. 
A research firm hired by El Paso, the Lukens Consulting Group, concluded that 
a complex chain reaction of factors -- not manipulation -- has rocked the 
state's natural gas industry and affected market dynamics and economics. 
"Higher electricity prices have caused an increase in demand for gas, which 
has led to higher prices of gas, which increased demand for pipeline 
capacity, which caused an increase in the price of pipeline capacity," the 
group said in a report distributed to legislators. 
But electricity generators, themselves under investigation in the Legislature 
for their pricing practices, make the reverse argument: Higher natural gas 
prices contributed to a rise in their costs for producing electricity. 
To support claims that El Paso acted unethically, the PUC says the company 
gave its affiliate an unfair competitive advantage in bidding for pipeline 
capacity to Southern California by: 
Structuring the auction to favor awarding the entire bloc to a single bidder. 
Twenty-four companies submitted bids for portions of the pipe. Only El Paso 
Merchant sought all of the capacity, offering $38.5 million for a 15-month 
contract. 
Failing to disclose to other bidders -- except El Paso Merchant -- that 
another affiliated company would soon offer discounted rates for use of an 
interconnection line extending from Topock into Southern California. 
Testifying before the Assembly committee, El Paso officials scoffed at the 
suggestion that their auction for pipeline capacity was rigged. 
The minimum price set for the pipeline space -- $37.5 million -- was a fair 
one. Auction terms stipulated the capacity would be parceled out if the total 
of all small bids exceeded the highest "total package" bid, the officials 
noted. 
There was nothing unusual about the El Paso affiliate, Mojave, offering a 
discount to its interconnection line. The line wasn't crucial to bidders. And 
all companies had the same opportunity to inquire about discount 
possibilities prior to submitting bids, the officials said. 
Attorney Peggy Heeg, an El Paso corporate vice president, said FERC strictly 
regulates relationships among affiliates. But it doesn't ban the types of 
rate discussions that an unrelated company might have with the corporation, 
she said. 
El Paso firms would and could not collude with each other to discourage 
competition, Heeg said. 
"(Affiliates) have to operate completely independently -- even if they have 
the same shareholders," she said. 

Delainey/Whaley buy off on the approach?

	James D Steffes

With the on-going discussions in CA, we need to make sure that we understand 
what would happen if a core / non-core split were implemented.

Basically, what is the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year price for a E-19 and E-20 
customer with a typical load profile?  Has to be all in (as if EES were 
selling gen only service).

Give me a call if this does not make sense.

Thanks,

Jim

I mean on the approach for dealing with Edison re: alternative structures for 
payment.  When's the drop dead for getting edits to Jennifer's "solution" 
piece.  You looking at it?

Best,
Jeff

Not a problem.  My concern is less about you and me---we both have views and 
are comfortable with the back and forth banter.  

I'm actually concerned about Carolyn.  She has worked hard on this, and I 
think wants to be involved and participatory. I had the sense that she was 
feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting 
room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in 
the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking a 
piece of the presentation for Thursday.  I was sensing that she was 
frustrated.  

Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think 
that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on 
his plate right now. 

My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that 
working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really expect 
to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product, given 
the nature of group dynamic.

I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about, which 
is a pretty good goal to go after.

Thanks a bunch for the note.

Jeff

Hey Jeff,

I hope you don't take anything personally when I disagree with you.  You are
a
very bright guy and a good speaker with good ideas.  There are always going
to
be disagreements when you get 4 opinionated people together.  Anyway, please
get
me your numbers by tomorrow so I can spend Tuesday night plugging things in
and
getting the presentation in good working order.  I want Anil to take a final
crack at it Wednesday so everyone can give comments and be done by
Thursdsay.

Jeff is correct that AB 1890 said NOTHING about direct access credits, said
nothing about whether such credits were to be market based, or whether
direct access customers were to be indifferent to their choice of power
providers.  All of the direct access credit rules were developed by the CPUC
in their approval of the direct access tariff rules (Rule 22) and in their
implementation of the utility cost recovery plans (the calculation of CTC).
Therefore, we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis.  We can
still argue for the DJ indexes as a more appropriate substitute for a PE
credit based just on Edison's cost of generation (retained generation plus
QFs plus DWR purchases) but we have to recognize that it the number is
higher than the PE credit, we will be effectively asking for a subsidy to
direct access providers from the utility's bundled customers.  I do not
expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy.  The bottom up tariff
structure is a much more likely result at this point.  Mike Day

Looks good, Scott.  One thing:  I admit I'm not a lawyer, so someone needs
to show me the precise language in AB 1890 that 1) requires the credit
(which, I believe was created by the PUC, not the legislature) to be based
on market and 2) requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA
suppliers.

Mike Day:  Do you concur with Scott's interpretation in AB 1890?

Like your arguments, Scott.  Just want to clarify that we're on solid legal
ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief and/or protest.

Best,
Jeff

 

                    Scott

                                         Subject:     Re: SCE Advice Filing
on PX Credit   
                                         -- Protest(Document link: Jeff
Dasovich)          
 

We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that
   the Px credit should be based on DJ-NP15 and DJ-SP15 rather than the
   defunct Px because AB1890 requires it to be based on market (not costs).
   Changing to procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB1890 which
   requires DA customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers.
   And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJ-NP15/SP15, that is the
   only appropriate available method.

Further, the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA
customers should be charged the generation surcharges ($10 +$30).  DA
customers should be given market based Px credits (based on DJNP15/SP15)
because its the law.  There are 2 possible interpretations resulting from
the combination of AB1890 and the new law.
   The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any
   surcharge.
   The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the $30 +
   $10 surcharges
Interpretation 1 results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other
customers.  It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent.
Interpretation 2 results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other
customers until the end of AB1890.  This seems like the likely
interpretation since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled
AB1890.  Thus given that the DA customers are being held indifferent to
frozen rates plus $40, they should get a Px market based credit plus pay
the surcharge until the rate freeze ends.

Once the Px credit ends (Mar 2002), the surcharge should end because the
law (AB1890) no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and
because:
   Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the
   utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they
   should not be charged for them.

In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value (if the courts
interpret the law differently than Enron) then there should be no
generation surcharge for DA customers.

This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting

Scott

JBennett <JBennett@GMSSR.com> on 04/20/2001 09:03:06 AM

As you are aware, SCE made an advice filing on April 5th to eradicate the
PX
Rate Schedule and Replace it with Schedule PE --Procured Energy.  As part
of
the filing, SCE proposes to set "on an interim basis" the cost of energy
procurement, for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the
calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the
Generation rate component of the Customer's otherwise applicable tariff.

Two primary issues arise from SCE's statement. First what does "interim
basis" mean -- how long will this be in effect.  In starts on January 19th,
but it is unclear as to when it would end. Second, and most important. is
what is meant by the Generation rate component.  While there is not much
explanation in the April 5 advice letter, in a subsequent advice letter
filed on April 11 (1533-E), SCE set forth "Rate Schedule Specific
Generation
Related Rates" which range between five and nine cents.

I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier.  We
need
to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday, April 25th.  All
thoughts on the matter are welcome.

Appreciate the speedy response.  Actually, it's a "personal" event opposed to 
a business reason, and though important, I don't think it clears your 
hurdle.  No problem.  Never hurts to inquire, and I appreciate the 
consideration.

you can take the exam by fax as close to the actual time as possible,

Jeff - 

Rubena called to see if you'd be available today for a conference call 
w/Harry Kingerski re: SCE PX Credit
at 2:30 our time/4:30 central.

Please so advise me your availability -- or preferable time, if need be?? -- 
ASAP.

Thanks,

Joseph

Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's 
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I 
apologize.  

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very 
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff 
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point, 
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me that, 
in a group, everyone should have some of their views included---that's what 
groups and compromises are all about.  After all, it's school.  We've made a 
lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to learn.

Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that 
you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I 
pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point, 
I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much 
use going to the mat.

Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has 
been, well, bumpy.

But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the 
presentation is better off for it.

Best,
Jeff

In all week (as best I can tell right now).

u still on call w/Edison?  jeff

when u get a chance, can you call and let me know how it went?  thanks. jeff

Dude:
Two things.  First, in the midst of the craziness on Friday, my black, 
Northface parka ended up getting put someplace at Sarah's that I wasn't 
privvy to, and consequently I couldn't find it.  My house keys are in it, so 
it would great to get it back.  Could you check with Bob/Sarah and see if 
it's floating around someplace over there?  Muchos gracias.

Second, could you do me a favor?  Could you pay me the full amount for Squaw 
and then collect from Cameron for what she owes you?  Sorry to be a pain in 
the ass, but I think logistically, it'll be a whole helluvalot easier to 
manage it that way (at least from my end).  And to be an even bigger 
pain.....since my schedule's a disaster with school coming to a close, could 
you stick the check in the mail?  My address is:

366 Dolores St., #3
SF, 94110

Sorry for all the hassle.

Happy birthday, man.

Best,
Jeff

Do you have a copy of the order?

Here are my comments.  Great job.  I think that the rate design table is a 
little impenetrable for folks who ain't close to it.  It might benefit from 
an addition bullet of explanation.

Best,
Jeff

You have specific questions about the order?  Perhaps the best thing to do is 
jot down the specific questions, then we can route them to folks in the know 
(which is likely to be more than one person).  That make any sense?

FYI.  Her take on the Senate going after the creditors' dedicated rate 
component as the first (and most important) change is on target in my view.

Jeff

Executive Summary
? FERC Considers Price Caps in the West
? Davis/SoCal Ed MOU subject to legislative revisions (we still stand by our 
early reports that the SoCal/Davis transmission deal will most likely fail 
and that SoCal will follow PG&E into bankruptcy court)

FERC mitigates price spikes in the West
FERC Chairman Hebert has placed a RTO West proposal onto the agenda for this 
week's meeting. The proposal would "mitigate" price surges by requiring 
generating companies to sell power into California and other western states 
during Stage 3 emergencies (when there is less than 1% surplus electricity in 
the grid) and cap the price generators could charge during these highest 
states of emergency. 
1)  The FERC proposal would not set price caps for any other time than Stage 
3 emergencies
2)  It would expire after a year
3)  It would set the top reference rate at "cost plus" based on the cost to 
produce electricity by the most inefficient producer 
FERC is also looking at initiatives that would encourage the agriculture 
industry to possibly sell their power and natural gas contracts instead of 
using them to produce their products. Although this proposal has not been 
formally approved or voted on at this time, the Chairman's control over 
FERC's agenda is absolute and nothing gets on the agenda he does not want to 
consider. Thus, if it stays on the agenda through meeting time, the odds of 
it passing are quite high if the meeting avoids total breakdown into 
hard-headed chaos. The key has been Commissioner Breathitt.  The two recently 
nominated Commissioners have not yet been approved by the Senate and so 
cannot vote this week. Thus any change in Breathitt's position definitively 
tips the balance of power in FERC.
Davis & SoCal. MOU not a Done Deal 
According to sources, the first legislative alteration to the Davis/SoCal MOU 
will involve removing the dedicated rate component necessary to repay SoCal's 
creditors.  This point only highlights the Senates' indecision on how to deal 
with paying off generators.  Solutions currently range from seizing assets to 
seeking legal relief for corporate price gouging and sources indicate that 
the QFs are still likely to file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal upon 
the Senate's first official sign of unwillingness to work with creditors.   

FYI.  The weekend of the 9th/10th is definitely out for me.  I'm sorry, honey.

April 23, 2001 SCAQMD OKs $1.7M to Buy, Install Capstone MicroTurbines 
WOODLAND HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)
The Governing Board of California's South Coast Air Quality Management 
District today approved $1.74 million to purchase 30- and 60-kilowatt 
microturbines and installation services from Capstone California, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Chatsworth-based Capstone Turbine Corp.

The SCAQMD notes in an agenda item document on its Web site that it intends 
to ``distribute the installation of 30 kW and 60 kW MicroTurbines over the 
counties of Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino. (SCAQMD) staff is in the 
process of identifying landfills that have waste gases that are not presently 
utilized, as well as schools, colleges, hospitals, and other suitable 
recipients that may be able to utilize these turbines for power generation... 
The proposed MicroTurbine project will produce clean power at various 
locations, using natural gas or landfill gas, and thus help mitigate the 
energy crisis to the extent feasible. Landfill gas utilization is a net 
environmental benefit since this energy may be currently wasted. The Capstone 
MicroTurbines will produce power with emissions typically lower than that of 
the average power generation mix in California, and with much lower emissions 
than stand-by diesel generators.''

In discussing microturbine technology, the document states, ``While several 
manufacturers have been developing MicroTurbine technology over the last few 
years, Capstone MicroTurbines are commercially available today in 30 kW and 
60 kW sizes, with reported NOx emissions below 9 ppm (at 15% O2) which 
represents very low emissions for this type of equipment. Capstone 
MicroTurbines are manufactured in Southern California and ... have been 
extensively tested at University of California, Irvine and found to be 
reliable and durable. At this time, they represent one of the cleanest and 
most readily available options for distributed power generation from 
MicroTurbines to mitigate the energy crisis in Southern California.''

One month ago, Capstone California announced a $4-million purchase of 
30-kilowatt Capstone MicroTurbines by the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power (www.ladwp.com). The purchase was part of an unprecedented cooperative 
agreement between the SCAQMD and the LADWP.

PRESS RELEASE 
Menlo Park, CA 
April 23, 2001 
TRADE GROUP BLASTS ISO PLAN TO STABILIZE MARKETS 
The Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF), last week sent federal regulators a 
stern warning that the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) plan 
to "stabilize" the California market will cause more blackouts in the West, 
chase away much-needed new generation, and jack up wholesale power costs. 
WPTF warned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that the CAISO 
proposal will have an extremely detrimental impact on power markets in 
California as well as other electricity markets throughout the Western 
Region.  "Their plan imposes price caps and curtailment of power exports," 
said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the group.  If approved, the CAISO 
plan, called the Market Stabilization Plan, will create disincentives for the 
development of additional generation capacity, precisely the wrong signal 
that needs to be sent at this time.  As a result, in addition to leading to 
higher costs, the Plan will impair reliability in California and throughout 
the West.  WPTF found that the CAISO's proposal to curtail exports is 
particularly troublesome and potentially interferes with interstate commerce 
in violation of the Federal Power Act ("FPA"). 
"This plan is yet another attempt to heap more rules on an already overruled 
market.  This is the kind of misguided thinking that got California into its 
current mess.  Their plan is too complex, academic, and does absolutely 
nothing to address the real issues of low supply and high demand. 
Consequently, the plan will have exactly the opposite effect," Ackerman 
commented. 
The WPTF supports the FERC's pro-competitive policies under Order No. 2000 
for regional approaches to interstate electricity markets. 
The membership of WPTF includes power marketers, scheduling coordinators, 
power exchanges, generators and other active participants in the restructured 
California electric market.  The members share a common mission of enhancing 
competition in electric markets. WPTF actions are focused on supporting the 
development of competitive electricity markets throughout the region and 
developing uniform operating rules to facilitate transactions among market 
participants. 
 

I love you very much and of course want to be together, but some things need 
to be worked out because there's too much depression and pain associated with 
those incidents.  They have to stop.  

I have never been embarrassed to be with you.  I'm as proud as can be.  I 
think that's something coming from within you that you need to work on, but 
I'm willing to help.

I don't want to end anything, but we need to fix it, or we'll have have to 
end it.  

I love you and miss you.

I just wanted to say again that I'm sorry about Friday night.  I'm sorry
about the way I acted and it was totally inappropriate.  It's also not how I
feel.  I don't feel animosity.  Sometimes I feel hurt because I feel like
sometimes you're embarassed to be associated with me.  But it's not
animosity and I'm sorry that that's the way I expressed it.  I love you and
I want us to be together and be happy.  I know I have some issues I need to
work on for that to happen and I'm willing to do that.  I'd rather do it
with you than alone.  If you want to end this relationship, I can't stop
you.  But I miss you and my life is very empty without you.

As you can see from below, I don't see how we can support the PE Advice 
Letter.  We reserved our right to oppose it in the stip.  I think we should 
clarify that SCE will acknowledge our full claim ($124 million) without any 
offset in exchange for our cooperation with the MOU.

Attached is our record of credit balances for Enron DA accounts, as of
April 20.  The $84 million or so I referenced this morning is our
calculation of what SCE owed through 1/18.  If the PE credit methodology is
approved and applied back to January 19, then Enron would be rebilled for
$68 million (for transmission and distribution charges), which offset
against the earlier credit and the credit calculated for 1/19 - 4/20,
reduces the total credit owed to $62 million.

As we discussed, Jenny is more familiar than I with the details of the
credits and will call you back with someone from our Billing/Credit group
who is even more familiar.

(See attached file: Enron PX Credits as of 4-20-01.xls)
 - Enron PX Credits as of 4-20-01.xls

FYI.  Bob Williams should be touching base with you; or it would be useful 
for you to touch base with him.  Edison appears to be staking out it's 
negotiating position with us through their filing.  

In short, they "recalculate" the PX credit post-Jan. 19 (when DWR took over 
procurement).  That recalculation turns our $125 MM dollar PX credit claim 
into $63MM.  So we're pretty far apart.  

We agreed at this point to oppose the filing and say:

1) through the end of the rate freeze, or end of 3.31.02, the status quo 
remains--"PX credit" based on market price (Dow Jones index).
2) however, if you want to go "utility purchase" price as the basis for the 
credit, then it must be the utility's full cost of power (retained 
gen+QFs+DWR+ISO real time).
3) negative credit during the transition can still occur.
3) Edison's proposal should be rejected.

Hi.  Did you hear from Sue Mara re: how the California ISO works?

Plz look up decision no. 01-04-006 on the commission's website.  it has to do 
with interruptible and curtailment issues and rotating outages, i.e., 
blackouts.

Thanks a million,
Jeff

Carpenter is saying that prices went up due to manipulation, pure and simple, 
we're saying that it's the reasons listed on the 1 1/2 pager that I sent.  
Give a call and we can discuss further.

The interim settlement never got voted out.  Therefore it ain't official, so 
there's no requirement yet to refile anything.  (Welcome to California.)  In 
fact, folks are still trying to get the Commission to reject the IS and 
approve the one that we worked on (though the chances of that are not huge, 
at this point).  Give a holler if there's anything else.

Gang:

I'm finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me w.r.t. 
siting reform.

One of our key messages in California and nationally is that price spikes are 
due in no small part to outmoded, arcane siting rules and a shortage of power 
as a result.  Price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps, 
investigations, utility under-recovery, and threats of rolling back 
de-regulation, to name a few.  

Understanding that Dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled 
about getting involved in more siting reform bills, could someone argue that 
from a corporate objective, getting a good siting reform bill passed this 
session is a fairly high priority?  I'm not sure what the answer is, but it 
struck me as I was pretty-ing up the document and I thought I'd put it out 
there for reaction.

Best,
Jeff

As you can see from below, I don't see how we can support the PE Advice 
Letter.  We reserved our right to oppose it in the stip.  I think we should 
clarify that SCE will acknowledge our full claim ($124 million) without any 
offset in exchange for our cooperation with the MOU.

Attached is our record of credit balances for Enron DA accounts, as of
April 20.  The $84 million or so I referenced this morning is our
calculation of what SCE owed through 1/18.  If the PE credit methodology is
approved and applied back to January 19, then Enron would be rebilled for
$68 million (for transmission and distribution charges), which offset
against the earlier credit and the credit calculated for 1/19 - 4/20,
reduces the total credit owed to $62 million.

As we discussed, Jenny is more familiar than I with the details of the
credits and will call you back with someone from our Billing/Credit group
who is even more familiar.

Best,

merci.

Can't wait to meet the little bundle of joy.

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to "obscene" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Calif. bill would penalize energy price gougers 

     "We are right now waiting on final language for a bill that would 
propose putting penalties on energy companies which have engaged in price 
gouging," the source said. 

     He said the bill, likely to be introduced in the Assembly Wednesday, 
would seek stiff financial penalties for violators. 

     It was not yet clear how long it would take for the bill to make its way 
to the Assembly floor for debate. 

     The bill follows a call earlier this month by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante 
for laws making it a felony for energy companies "to charge unreasonable and 
unjust energy rates". 

     A spokesman for Bustamante confirmed the proposed legislation would 
address California's soaring natural gas prices, more than quadruple what 
they were a year ago and now the highest in the nation, but was unsure when 
the bill would go to the Assembly. 

     High natural gas prices have played a key role in pushing up power 
prices because gas-fired turbines are the single biggest source of 
electricity in California, providing more than a third of the power used by 
the state's 34 million residents. 

     California's power crisis stems from a 1996 deregulation plan that 
allowed wholesale prices to soar but capped retail rates. The result has been 
a string of rolling blackouts in January and March, rising rates, a spotty 
power supply and the bankruptcy of the state's biggest utility. 

     But a number of state officials believe price gouging and illegal 
activity have been behind the sharp rise in power and gas prices in 
California. 

     The California Independent System Operator, which operates most of the 
state power grid, filed two reports with federal regulators in late March 
alleging more than $6 billion in overcharges by wholesale power suppliers 
over a 10-month period. 

     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates interstate 
electricity and gas sales and transmission, has also accused 13 western power 
generators of overcharging California utilities $124 million for wholesale 
power in January and February. 

     FERC ordered $69 million in refunds on power bought in January and $55 
million for purchases in February. 

     Energy companies like Duke Energy , EL Paso Energy Corp. and Dynegy have 
repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in California's chaotic wholesale power 
market, arguing the prices they charge reflect the underlying cost of power 
generation, tight supplies throughout the region, and the high financial risk 
of doing business in the state. 

     Last week, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked San Francisco 
Superior Court to force power generators Reliant Energy Inc. and Mirant Corp. 
to turn over documents subpoenaed in his probe of possible price gouging in 
the state after the two firms failed to produce the documents. 

     Lockyer, who initiated this investigation last August, is also 
conducting a similar investigation into whether anti-competitive practices 
are behind the rise in gas prices. 

     It is unknown when that investigation will be completed. 

     

This is a very good synopsis of the gas crimes trials in California.  Pleas=
e=20
note comments of Assembly Republican John Campbell---perhaps the sole brigh=
t=20
spot in the California Legislature...

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
"didn=01,t see any smoking gun" in either report.

"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies," Campbell=20
said. "I believe FERC
is looking at this situation " and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place."

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. "It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: "There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission."

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

Yes, I can do the call.

Wanted to make sure u knew:  S&P downgraded CA rating--two notches--from AA 
to A+.  Only Louisiana is lower.  AND S&P kept CA on cred. watch--could go 
lower.  It's slipping thru Davis' fingers.  Jeff

Also, talked to M. Day.  those one-pagers should be coming in the next hour.

Thanks Jim.  ENA is very interested in this topic.  I was talking with Mona 
last week about my view that a strategy with PG&E should be supportive, not 
adversarial.    ENA is extremely interested in a gas management position with 
PG&E and they have made it clear to us that our public positions against them 
are a significant commercial issue.  I will spend some time with Portland and 
SF to get an ENA consensus on these points.

FYI.  

If you are not aware, PG&E is pushing for immediate end of their retail rate 
cap (so they can collect wholesale energy costs).  

EES is considering its positions in that matter to prepare for CPUC and 
legislative proceedings.

I want to make sure that you are aware of these internal discussions.  Key 
from EPMI include (1) endorse Cal ISO report conclusions, (2) competititve 
default supplier, (3) increasing rate freeze for all customers, and (4) 
transfer of PG&E Hydro to affiliate at $2.8B (to offset current 
undercollection).

Please let me know if these positions make sense to you.  While I think that 
our general position is retail volatility, given the current situation in 
SDG&E that is simply impossible politically.

Please feel free to call.

Jim

I met with Dennis Benevides, Jim Wood and Scott Gahn about the PG&E strategy 
we discussed and the EES perspective.  Suggestions:

Endorse the recent CAL ISO report on causes of the problem (no utility 
forward buying, no demand responsiveness, etc) and say, with a few tweaks, 
their proposals were on target.

Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01.  Retroactive roll-off would be 
devastating.

Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier 
in place (get them out of merchant supply).

Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration.

Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of 
under-recoveries until out years. 

Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as 
possible, post '01.

Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts:
  Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be 
definitive.  Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the 
right numbers.

From a retail perspective, this blends protection of the book with 
advancement of new market opportunity.  I may still get more feedback from 
the EES guys, but wanted to give you what I got so far.

Heard from Lawrence this morning who said AB 60x (Hertzberg) is likely to be
heard in the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday next week.  He said the
committee at this time is fairly neutral on the bill since he doesn't see
that it does anything.  He understands our problems with the bill, but
suggested we may want to recommend a solution.  IEP will be meeting with him
this afternoon to give him the problem at the 50,000 foot level.  Individual
companies may want to give him the specifics.

Where are we with our meetings with members of the committee?

IEP met with Kip in Sher's office who was noncommittal, but agreed with our
arguments against the bill. IEP's meeting with Alarcon was cancelled.  We
are trying to reschedule.  Since this is a special session bill, Dunn and
Poochigian will be voting on the bill.

WPTF has just voted to file a protest on Amendment 30 (the ISO is asking to 
be able to buy power for itself in the forward market).  I agreed to fund as 
did 4, maybe 5, others.  The discussion was not exactly as you describe below 
but I will be able to have lots of input on the filing, and am sure I can get 
the points included.  Therefore, I recommend that Enron NOT make a separate 
filing on this.

Here is what WPTF voted on:  Ask FERC to limit ISO procurement only to the 
super peak product that has already been developed by the APX and require 
that the price caps end in 6 months; if the ISO wishes to renew the price 
caps it would have to file 60 days in advance of the 6-month deadline.

Mary Hain@ECT
09/28/2000 12:28 PM
Sue- in WPTF's protest of Amendment 30, is WPTF proposing to make the 
following arguments?  If not we need to have Ron give an estimate for an RCR 
and draft a protest.

Amendment 30, which would allow the Cal ISO to do limited forward contracting 
and to allocate the costs thereof to under/overschedulers (protests due 
Oct.2)the traders would like to say that the ISO should not be in the forward 
market, rather the IOUs should be in the forward market and should be 
incented to do so.  Rather than doing anything to fix this failure to hedge 
and underscheduling by the IOUs, this filing would further amplify the 
problem by concentrating even more transactions with the ISO and lead to the 
slippery slope to the ISO running the entire market.  

Since, the filing also creates other problems.  Through the proposal to do 
bilateral deals without first receiving bids, the ISO moved itself out of 
compliance with Order No. 2000 (assuming it ever complied) by starting to 
violate the independence characteristic - the FERC's first minimum 
characteristic for an RTO.  Under this, the RTO is required to be independent 
of market participants.  Order No. 2000 defines a market participant as any 
entity or its affiliate that buys or sells electric energy in the RTO's 
region or in any neighboring region that might be effected by the RTO's 
actions.  

Further, the ISO is already buying out of market and this move would further 
complicate existing problems that we have with OOM.

In addition, although the filing claims that it's request is  limited, yet 
there is no time limitation.  Further, the limitation seems to have little 
real effect. 

   

There have been several recent filings related to California that you may 
wish to intervene in and/or protest:

1.  CAISO proposal to extend price cap (ER00-3673-000) (due Oct. 5);

2.  CAISO compliance filing with San Diego order to make limited forward 
contracting and to allocate the costs for those contracts to SCs whose 
forward schedules do not reflect their actual real-time demands.  
(ER00-3636-000) (due Oct. 2);

3.  City of Vernon filing to join ISO (EL00-105-000) (due September 29).  
This filing triggers the CAISO's TAC charge effective 1/1/01;

4.  Complaint by Cities of Anaheim, Azusa, etc. regarding the CAISO's 
collection of OOM incurred to meet system reliability and to require the 
CAISO to abide by the cap in Neutrality Adjustment Charge.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you wish to intervene in and/or 
protest any of these filings.  Thanks.  Ron

If Ken Lay's going to Sac to have meetings, seems that he should meet 
w/Burton.  You agree?  Thx, Jeff

Rosalee:
Thanks very much for helping arrange the meetings.  Here is the list thus 
far.  There may be additions.  I've also suggested dates for the meetings.

May 3rd in Sacramento (after the meeting with David Freeman):

Governor Davis (he spends a lot of time in Los Angeles and you may find that 
he prefers to meet there).
House Speaker Robert Hertzberg
House Republican member John Campbell (Republican's point person on energy 
issues)
House Minority Leader David Cox
Senate Majority Leader John Burton
Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte

May 4th--Morning, in Los Angeles
John Bryson, CEO Edison International
Governor Davis (unless the meeting occurs on the 3rd in Sacramento)

May 4th--Afternoon, in San Francisco
Bob Glynn, CEO PG&E

Joseph Alamo from our office will provide you with the phone numbers for John 
Campbell, David Cox, John Burton, and Jim Brulte.  I assume that your office

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will 
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  
All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, 
will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) 

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission 
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  
Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, 
within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs 
in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  
(24-7)  

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. 

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 
or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due 
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold 
of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited 
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within 
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  
Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.  

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PG&E bankruptcy filing.  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
keep you posted.

Jeff,

Sorry, I should have mentioned when we spoke that Prof Aceves already said it
would be OK to join a group with 4, making it 5. He knew that would be the
case. He suggested I pick a group, rather than him just randomly choosing one
to assign me to. You seemed nice based on my initial reaction to meeting you,
which is why I approached you about it.

If the group has reservations based on my past group's experience, please let
them know that the situation arose because I was out of the country for a week
and a half without email access, and therefore wasn't able to contribute to
two weeks of assignments. I had let Prof Aceves know about this planned
business-related absence even before the course started, so he didn't penalize
me. He forgot that I was the person who had sent him that note when my group
approached him to let him know I hadn't contributed to two assignments. He
said based on that, he would speak to the group to put me back in it if I
wanted, or I could join another group. I hadn't had any conflicts whatsoever
with the other group, I just had been out of communication, but I felt that
given what had happened starting with a fresh group would be easier. In my
opinion, it was just unfortunate that this trip happened two weeks into the
class, before I could prove myself to my old group.

If you can communicate both of these things to your other group members, I
really would like to join you all. My alternative at this point would be to do
the next assignment individually, since I wouldn't be able to find another
group until two weeks from now, and then have the professor assign me to one.

I greatly appreciate your help. If I can join you all, please let me know as
soon as possible so I can make sure I contribute to the next assignment.

Thanks,
Christine

looking at it right now.

One minor edit---it's the PX, not the ISO, that's taken itself into voluntary 
bankruptcy.  See redline version attached.  

Only other comment:  I'm not sure that, technically/contractually, we entered 
into transactions with the PX (in the same way that I don't think that folks 
enter into transactions with NYMEX).  (See opening line of last paragraph.)  

We have exposure to thePX based on our commercial activity that took place 
through the PX, and that exposure depends on how the PX /FERC decide 
particular issues.  In short, we have transactions with the utilities, and 
exposure to the PX based on transactions that we entered into with other 
counter parties via the PX market mechanism.  That said, seems to me that, 
for the purposes of the disclosure, the language is fine---just want to raise 
the flag. Might be useful to run it by Richard Sanders.

Hope this helps.

10,000 creditors seek PG&E billions 
Confidential list reveals each vendor's claim

The plight of PG&E's vast array of business partners, many of which are owed 
millions of dollars, is made painfully clear in a confidential list of 
creditors now being compiled for the utility's bankruptcy proceedings. 
A copy of the list, obtained by The Chronicle, illustrates the impact of the 
third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on PG&E's thousands of vendors. 
This also is the first time the monetary value is being revealed for each 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. contract. 
"It's going to be a cat fight," said Cathy Moran, a Mountain View bankruptcy 
attorney. "They'll be fighting over a limited pot of money, and each party 
will be seeking preferential treatment." 
The $9 billion owed by the utility to its more than 10,000 creditors 
constitutes the largest-ever bankruptcy involving a utility. The need to keep 
California's lights on adds a virtually unprecedented level of complexity to 
the proceedings. 
Companies on the creditor list run the gamut from huge to tiny. IBM Corp. and 
Pacific Bell are joined by the likes of Pete's Auto Body Shop in Merced and 
Sponges Car Wash in San Ramon. 
"We provide gas and electricity to 13 million people," said Ron Low, a PG&E 
spokesman. "Behind all the poles and wires are thousands of employees and the 
thousands of vendors who support them." 
He said every department at the utility had spent weeks pulling together 
information for the creditor list, to be submitted to Bankruptcy Judge Dennis 
Montali by mid-May. 
'REPAY ALL OUR CREDITORS' 
"We've had to look at all the contracts we have with companies and 
individuals," Low said. "It is our intention to repay all our creditors." 
Whether the various creditors receive all, some or none of the cash owed them 
will be determined once a reorganization plan is worked out, perhaps years 
down the road. 
The Bankruptcy Court will contact all PG&E creditors and invite them to 
submit what is known as a "proof of claim" -- evidence that the creditor 
indeed is owed money. 
This is a matter taken very seriously by San Martin's Allwaste 
Transportation, a chemical disposal firm, which relies on PG&E for about a 
quarter of its total revenues. 
As it happened, an Allwaste technician was pumping hazardous waste out of 
PG&E's Humboldt Bay power plant near Eureka at the exact same time that the 
utility was filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
Payment for that service, as with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of 
other jobs, is now in limbo as a result of PG&E's bankruptcy. 
'THEY STUCK WITH US' 
"PG&E is very important to us," said Lee Soares, Allwaste's operations 
manager. "This is definitely a hit." 
He added, however, that his company would stand behind the utility. "They 
stuck with us when we went bankrupt," Soares acknowledged. 
Many of PG&E's creditors reflect the utility's core operations. For example, 
the list contains numerous affiliates involved with power poles, trimming 
trees around electricity lines or laying pipes for natural gas transmission. 
Meanwhile, other creditors speak to the nuts and bolts of running a business 
with 21,500 workers and far-reaching activities. 
If a PG&E truck is involved in a fender-bender in the East Bay, it might be 
taken to The Masters body shop in Hayward, which has a contract with the 
utility valued at $28,800. 
"We do a lot of work for them," said co-owner Jan Masters. "We'd miss the 
account if they stopped coming." 
That hasn't happened yet. Masters said PG&E had continued bringing its 
vehicles to her two-person shop since the bankruptcy filing. So far, the 
utility has paid its bills promptly. 
"They don't get the vehicle back if we don't get paid," Masters noted. 
One of the most prominent creditors on PG&E's list is Hertz Equipment Rental 
Corp. The utility's $13 million contract makes it Hertz's single biggest 
corporate client in the Bay Area and one of its largest in the nation. 
500 PAYMENTS DUE HERTZ 
According to the creditor list, PG&E has nearly 500 payments for various 
equipment and vehicle rentals outstanding with Hertz. The individual 
transactions range in value from as much as $97,539 to as little as $1. 
"We provide a lot of equipment for them, heavy construction equipment to 
build things," said Diana Kirby, who handles the PG&E account at Hertz's 
Rohnert Park headquarters. "Basically, they couldn't afford to purchase all 
the items they rent from us. 
"Their filing for bankruptcy will have a large impact on us," she added. "But 
we'll weather the storm. What else can we do?" 
That's the dilemma facing all PG&E creditors, large and small. A select 
committee of the utility's largest creditors will seek to represent other 
vendors during the bankruptcy proceedings. 
In typical Chapter 11 cases, this arrangement tends to work smoothly for all 
concerned. But in a case as sprawling and complicated as PG&E's 
reorganization, there is a possibility that the interests of smaller 
creditors can get lost in the shuffle. 
The bankruptcy judge could seek to simplify things by addressing the claims 
of PG&E's smaller creditors first, thus reducing the size of the playing 
field when the big guys begin duking it out. 
"This case is going to write its own rules," predicted Moran, the bankruptcy 
lawyer. "You've got a very large number of dollars and the public interest 
involved." 
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
You also have a situation in which PG&E's financial demise has made 
bedfellows of companies and individuals that might otherwise have never 
crossed paths. 
Xerox Corp. now stands arm-in-arm with Hayward's A-1 Septic Tank Service. 
Enterprise Rent-A-Car is a comrade of Modesto's Jack Frost Ice Service. 
Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto has more than 40 claims outstanding for 
computer services ranging in value from $22 to $72,583. But the company 
already is looking ahead to new deals. 
"PG&E has been a good customer," said Randy Lane, an H P spokesman. "We would 
expect that, after the proceedings are done, they'll continue to be a good 
customer." 
On the other hand, freelance photographer Steve Castillo in Menlo Park has a 
contract with PG&E valued at $25,000 to shoot pictures for the utility's in- 
house newsletter. That was when times were good. 
"I assume I'm not going to get any more calls from them," Castillo said.

Governor Gray Davis has asked that we apprise Member Companies of the
Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, and our regional and statewide business
colleagues, on the ways that employers can participate in conservation and
energy-efficiency programs that save power and money.

PLEASE NOTE that the Governor has recently signed into law a number of ways
that employers can participate to save money.  I hope you will forward this
to the appropriate person in your company to take advantage of this
program - and to help our State avoid rolling blackouts this summer.

Thank you very much.

INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR (ISO) INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAMS:

* Demand Reduction Program (DRP): This program will pay customers a monthly
reservation payment of $20,000/MW/month to be available on weekdays between
11:00 AM and 7:00 PM from June 1 through September 30 to curtail at ISO
request, and will additionally receive $500/MWh for curtailed demand.  This
program is open to customers with a minimum aggregated load bid of 1 MW.
Total curtailment time is limited to 24hr/month.

Contact: Don Fuller (916) 351-4445 <http://www2.caiso.com/clientserv/load/>

* Discretionary Curtailment Program (DLCP): This program is similar to the
VDRP.  It is a voluntary program that will pay customers a similar incentive
to the VDRP to curtail load when called upon by the ISO.  This program is
open to customers with a minimum aggregated load of 1 MW.

Contact: Don Fuller (916) 351-4445 <http://www2.caiso.com/clientserv/load/>

METERING AND OTHER DEMAND-RESPONSIVE SYSTEMS

CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION (CEC) PROGRAMS:

month will receive meters that will enable them to better track and manage
their energy use and participate in demand reduction programs.

Contact: Don Kazama CEC website and 800 number
www.energy.ca.gov/peakload; 1-800-555-7794

* Demand Responsive Building Systems: This program provides grants to
businesses to reduce demand in commercial buildings.  This technology
reduces electricity demand during peak periods by automatically raising
thermostats, dimming appropriate lighting and reducing the electricity use
of other building systems.

Contact: Scott Matthews CEC website and 800 number
www.energy.ca.gov/peakload; 1-800-555-7794

* Innovative Peak Load Reduction: This program takes full advantage of the
innovations of the private sector to generate innovative solutions to reduce
peak demand. Grants will be awarded to businesses for efficiency projects
including, but not limited to, lighting and cooling efficiency improvements,
solar cooling, building energy management controls, electric generation from
landfill gas, and solar systems.

MORE ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMS AND TIPS:

* Inspectors from private firms called ESCOs (Energy Service Companies) can
audit your building, identify how you can reduce energy costs, specify the
equipment needed, finance the project, install the equipment and then
guarantee that it will operate properly. Generally, the ESCO shares the
financial risk associated with the project and in return keeps some of the
savings on your energy bill. Call your utility company for more details.

GOVERNOR'S RATE PROPOSAL:

The Governor's proposal allocates the same percentage rate increase to
residential and to commercial/industrial customers and makes changes only to
businesses' current rate structures.  Customers on time-of-use rates, as
well as those who are not, would receive the same percentage increase.
Time-of-use increases would be allocated only to the peak and mid-peak
rates, in an effort to encourage more intensive conservation at times when
it is most needed. The Governor also supports a direct access option for
business customers that ensures the financial stability of the bridge loan
and revenue bonds that are needed to back the state's power purchases.

which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state 
suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any 
questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think 
might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?

thank you.  nice job on the call today.

FYI.  This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group=
=20
that Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t=
he=20
legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California=
=20
Border.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20
presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El=
=20
Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20
presentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've=
=20
seen in the press.

Best,
Jeff
Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
"didn=01,t see any smoking gun" in either report.

"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies," Campbell=20
said. "I believe FERC
is looking at this situation " and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place."

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. "It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: "There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission."

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20

controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=

hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=

up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=

Just for the record, I just reviewed my "Jeff's Goals for 2001" that Paul and 
I worked up, and "doing time for the company" didn't make the list this year.

Paul, I double-checked and "dating Loretta Lynch" is, likewise, not on the 
list.

Thanks to all.  Ended up working out pretty well.  We may have been the only 
folks thus far that finished within 20 minutes (or 45 minutes, it seems, for 
that matter).

Best,
Jeff

you still ain't got it?  I sent it to you twice yesterday.  You think we have 
an email problem?

Best,
Jeff

thank you

The Bryson meeting will likely be Steve and Ken, or me and Steve and Ken---at 
least that's the poop that I've received thus far.

Best,
Jeff

Give me a call.  I'm thinking that from your note, the CA meetings are 
getting in your way.  I was hoping that KL could meet with Bryson on the 4th, 
but looks like they already scheduled.  I just want to make sure that Rosie 
doesn't get all crossed up with many of us sending her stuff.  Let's talk and 
maybe I can get the Bryson meeting rearranged.

Your pal,
Jeff

Hey buddy:
I'm going to have to bail on the solutions doc at this point so that I can 
focus on the backgrounder, the MOU and the buy down.  Also, I'll be in 
Houston on Monday.
Best,
Jeff

you get a chance to see the work that I did on the document and sent you 
yesterday?

Hi:
I'm going to call you in a bit--I'm on a conference call right now.  We need 
to coordinate just a wee bit.  Landwehr's all over Rosie, and we're getting 
mixed up between her RGA meetings and the CA meetings. I talked to her a 
little this AM and expressed a concern that we not get poor Rosie all wrapped 
around an axle and confused.  We may have several points of contact here for 
various issues.  No big deal, but I want to make sure things don't get more 
complicated than they need to be.  I'll forward you a note from Sue to Rosie 
(and me) that you weren't on.  Also want to talk about your voicemail last 
night--i.e., I may need to travel with KL, which is fine by me if that's 
necessary.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks.  We need to reign Sue in just a teensy bit.

oh man.  I sent to you yesterday---the solutions piece.  did a bunch of work 
on it.  here it is.

chk email for the stuff i did yesterday on solutions doc.  lots of edits and 
did consistent formatting.  jeff

on interminable conference calls.  i'll call les.

Jim:
Here's the DG stuff from the Hertzberg letter
Key Barriers to the Development of Distributed Generation and Proposals to=
=20
Remove the Barriers

Barrier:  Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution
The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a step in=
=20
the right direction, but don=01,t go nearly far enough.  Utility stand-by=
=20
charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopol=
y=20
position, extract monopoly prices from customers, or both.  They must be=20
eliminated for all distributed generation applications.  There is no reason=
=20
to limit the elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are=
=20
less than 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it=
=20
takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand=
=20
and reduce the risk of black outs this summer.=20

The provisions of SB27X eliminating stand-by charges were stripped from the=
=20
bill.  This will likely thwart any attempts to encourage the near-term=20
development of distributed generation and reduce the severe supply-demand=
=20
imbalance in California.

The language eliminating stand-by charges should be re-inserted into SB27X=
=20
and modified to remove all caps on plant size.=20
=20
Barrier: Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities=
=20
with investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:  =20
The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in th=
e=20
right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete interconnection=
=20
studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this requirement=20
applies to all generation facilities, including distributed generation.  In=
=20
addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting=
=20
generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive=
=20
orders or other regulations. =20

To the greatest extent possible, California should shift control over=20
interconnection away from the utility and place that control with the=20
California ISO.  This could be accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Barrier:  Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution:=20
California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru D-26-01)=
=20
issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output=
=20
apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facilities. =
In=20
addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to face=
=20
local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial interests=
=20
cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects. =20

These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
04/26/2001 

GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS 
TO PROVIDE POWER TO CALIFORNIA
SACRAMENTO 
Governor Gray Davis has signed three executive orders to increase 
stabilization, conservation and generation of power in California. 
Executive Order D-34-01
Many numerous and complicated statutes, regulations, policies and procedures 
are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in SB 5X 
and AB 29X signed by the Governor two weeks ago. Executive Order D-34-01 will 
speed up implementation of the measures.
Together, the two bills provide over $850 million for energy conservation and 
distributed generation programs designed to save over 2,000 megawatts this 
summer. With the Executive Order, the Energy Commission will not have to go 
through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding. The 
programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included:
Public Agency Loans and Grants (ECAA); 
Time-Of-Use and Real-Time Meters; 
Municipal Program; and 
Cool Roofs/Building Materials
Executive Order D-33-01
Governor Davis signed Executive Order D-33-01 to extend the conservation 
rebate of the "20/20" program to the customers in the territory serviced by 
the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The program is designed to help the 
state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who 
significantly conserve energy. In addition, it could save the state up to 
$1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state 
must buy during expensive summer peak periods. 
Executive Order D-32-01
In Executive Order D-32-01, Governor Davis orders the transfer of funds from 
the Energy Commission to the Department of Water Resources for implementation 
of the power plant construction incentive program. Incentives will include: 
$5,000 per megawatt (MW) of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and

Just so we're all on the same page......Dasovich will arrive in Houston on 
Monday (mid-day) and will travel with Dr. Lay beginning on Wednesday (to 
Austin) and then on to LAX, Sacramento etc.  Steve said there really isn't 
time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that Ken has will have to be 
addressed enroute to CA.  

Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over 
the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week.  

the offer's still good...

Last week you expressed a willingness to marry for money.

OK, I'm a mindless idiot.  And an embarrassed one at that.  To which offer 
are you referring?  

Also, learned that PG&E's big "want" in the Son of Gas Accord is a few 
hundred million to build more Tx and Local Tx.  Sounds like this could have 
an IMMENSE negative impact on TW.  You better get your fanny out here, like 
pronto.  I sense death and destruction.

i got an email bounced back from your address.  let me know if you get this 
one.

Greetings:

On the call between Ken Lay and Bob Hertzberg, Hertzberb asked us to resend 
any thoughts (and any more detail) we have on demand buy-downs.  I've 
combined our on-line auction proposal with the "federal" solution recently 
worked up for the Cheney meetings (I tailored it for California 
consumption).  

Hertzberg wanted it today in advance of meetings that he's having in 
Washington next week.  Scott Governor will deliver this to Hertzberg's office 
today.  Sorry for quick turn around, but if folks have comments, could you 
send them to me pronto so that Scott can deliver to Hertzberg's office before 
COB?  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

I have cleared my calendar, so any time in the morning works for me.

RECENT EVENTS

-- Rule #1: Never assume an issue is done until the ink is dry from the
Governor's signature (and even then you never know).  The Senate Republicans
agreed late this week to oppose SB 28x (Sher), which makes several
IEP-sponsored proposals to the siting process, due to a controversial
provision added in the Assembly Appropriations Committee regarding
unemployment compensation.  Assembly Republicans let it slide on process
because CMTA and the Chamber's objections to the egregious language was so
last minute.  Senate Republicans had more time to look at the issue and
agreed not to let it go forward.  Since they control of the final vote in a
bill requiring two-thirds, their united opposition stopped the bill, one
vote shy.  The author was granted reconsideration and discussions will be
on-going over the next week on how to proceed.  The best-case scenario at
this point is getting one Republican to drop from the ranks.  Worst-case
scenario is the bill dies, and our language gets picked up in another
vehicle starting the whole process all over again.  The more likely
scenario, however, lies somewhere in between.  Parties will agree to some
compromise language, send the bill back to the Assembly to make the
appropriate changes, then bring it back to the Senate for a clean vote.

-- Long-term contracting was moved to the front burner this week by Asm.
Wright (AB 57) and Senator Morrow (SB 997), both with different results.
Both measures, which are almost identical, set forth a criteria which, if
followed by an IOU when signing a long-term contract with an energy
supplier, would eliminate the need for a reasonableness review by the CPUC.
AB 57 passed out of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce committee with
little discussion and a few technical amendments.  SB 997 faced a longer,
more difficult hearing in front of Senator Bowen's Energy Committee.  IEP,
along with the three IOUs testified in support of the measure, while TURN
expressed great concerns with the concept of leaving the CPUC out of the
picture.  In the end, the Senate committee agreed to put the bill off for
further discussions, passed a motion in support of getting the appropriate
rule waver so the bill can be heard again after Friday's policy committee
deadline, and scheduled a stakeholder meeting for Thursday morning.  Senator
Burton announced on the Senate Floor Thursday morning, however, that all
requests for rule wavers would be denied.  AB 57 appears to be the only
active vehicle on this issue, and IEP will be at the negotiating table
providing input on the language as it moves forward.

-- AB 60x is scheduled for hearing next week in the Senate Energy Committee.
IEP met with committee staff this week, which revealed some possible
latitude in amending the bill.  IEP and other member company lobbyists will
be pushing hard for an opposed position from the rest of the committee
before the hearing Tuesday afternoon.  At this time, however, we do not have
any alternative language for the bill.  After further review by some IEP
member companies, the previously drafted amendments appear unworkable and
were withdrawn from consideration.  We anticipate on waiting to see where
the committee on Tuesday takes the issue before another attempt at drafting
alternative language.

-- SB 1x (Soto/Scott) was amended this week before its hearing in the Senate
Appropriations committee next week.  The new language finds a backdoor to
the price cap issue by imposing a 100 percent tax on the sale of electric
power that exceeds a base price of $80 per MW/hr.  CMTA, the Chamber and
CalTax will be coordinating strategy for the hearing with IEP and the
generators, but despite the bill's multiple constitutional and legal
problems, most admit the measure will move forward with little trouble.  A
new player on the scene will probably provide the most noteworthy testimony.
InterGen North America, which is developing a 900 MW power plant in Palm
Springs, plans on testifying that if this measure is signed by the Governor,
they will absolutely pull the project and go to Oklahoma.

-- Newly amended this week is AB 67x (Cardoza), which now makes it a felony
for a corporation that sells electricity or natural gas at unjust or
unreasonable rates. Sponsored by Lt. Governor Bustamante, the measure
establishes stiff fines and possible jail time, that could be subject to the
state's "three strikes" law.  AB 67x has already generated opposition from
Republicans and constitutional questions from legal experts.   Although
Cardoza noted that several aspects of the bill are unresolved and could
change, the intent will remain the same, and he insists that energy
companies that take advantage of Californians will still face significant
penalties.

-- SB 6x, (Burton), which establishes a State Power Authority, passed the
Assembly this week by a 48 to 28 vote.  The measure needs the Senate to
concur on the Assembly amendments before it heads to the Governor's desk.

-- Attached are the most recent legislative tracking reports for both the
special and regular sessions.  Please call if you need copies of any of the
bills.

Rob had Robert Michaels give me a ring re: potential panelist at the field 
hearing.  Be happy to pitch him to Ms Van Way.  Thoughts?

This mean we'll be toning down our criticism of the utility's behavior in the 
California market in our filings at FERC regarding the price spike 
investigation?

Thanks Jim.  ENA is very interested in this topic.  I was talking with Mona 
last week about my view that a strategy with PG&E should be supportive, not 
adversarial.    ENA is extremely interested in a gas management position with 
PG&E and they have made it clear to us that our public positions against them 
are a significant commercial issue.  I will spend some time with Portland and 
SF to get an ENA consensus on these points.

James D Steffes@EES

FYI.  

If you are not aware, PG&E is pushing for immediate end of their retail rate 
cap (so they can collect wholesale energy costs).  

EES is considering its positions in that matter to prepare for CPUC and 
legislative proceedings.

I want to make sure that you are aware of these internal discussions.  Key 
from EPMI include (1) endorse Cal ISO report conclusions, (2) competititve 
default supplier, (3) increasing rate freeze for all customers, and (4) 
transfer of PG&E Hydro to affiliate at $2.8B (to offset current 
undercollection).

Please let me know if these positions make sense to you.  While I think that 
our general position is retail volatility, given the current situation in 
SDG&E that is simply impossible politically.

Please feel free to call.

Jim

I met with Dennis Benevides, Jim Wood and Scott Gahn about the PG&E strategy 
we discussed and the EES perspective.  Suggestions:

Endorse the recent CAL ISO report on causes of the problem (no utility 
forward buying, no demand responsiveness, etc) and say, with a few tweaks, 
their proposals were on target.

Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01.  Retroactive roll-off would be 
devastating.

Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier 
in place (get them out of merchant supply).

Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration.

Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of 
under-recoveries until out years. 

Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as 
possible, post '01.

Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts:
  Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be 
definitive.  Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the 
right numbers.

From a retail perspective, this blends protection of the book with 
advancement of new market opportunity.  I may still get more feedback from 
the EES guys, but wanted to give you what I got so far.

Thanks very much.  I think, rather than Crawford, you might be referring to 
David Cox, Republican leader of the California Assembly?  Really can't thank 
you enough for you help on this.  Have a great weekend.

Best,
Jeff

One more e-mail!  I have calls into all the offices.  I need to call 
Crawford's office back late on Monday (talked to his Chief of Staff - Matt 
Back).  We left it that the others will call me back.

Confirmed are:  John Bryson - 3:30 on May 2 in L.A. (I have a call in to move 
that one later, if possible).
David Freeman - 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on May 3 in Sacramento;  Robert 
Hertzberg - 1:00 p.m. on May 3 in Sacramento; Bob Glynn - 9:00 a.m. on May 4 
in San Francisco.

More later. 

FYI.  given this info, there's a chance that i might try to get in.  how's 
the sign-u look at this point?

Dudes:
I'm am officially responsible for the case and of course appreciate all 
Dylan's (and everyone else's) efforts.  Here's my game plan.  I'm going to 
spend the day working on it---adding to what's already been passed around.  
Dylan, I'll look at the numbers and perhaps send you (and others) thoughts 
regarding the crunching, since you've already starting crunching.  I'll try 
to do as much of the write-up (building on what others have done) and send 
around by COB today.  Once everyone's had a chance to comment, etc. I'll 
finalize tomorrow night.  I have to fly to Houston at the crack of dawn on 
Monday and therefore can't go to class, so I'm hoping that someone else can 
turn it in.  Let me know if this works for folks.

That just seems ridiculous, give where they=01,re trading.

Anyway, here=01,s where my analysis is heading----tell me if I=01,m smoking=

The deal isn=01,t really $175 per share.  It=01,s $175 LESS the taxes that =

Thanks to all for your comments.  I've tried to weave together the various 
(and insightful) comments I received from folks with the great stuff that 
Dylan put together initially and the stuff that I whipped up. They're 
attached.  Please proof the thing---I fear that there's a typo, or two.  
Since I'm off to beatiful Houston at the crack of dawn, Dylan has graciously 
agreed to take any further comments, integrate them,  and print the final 
thing out to turn in at class tomorrow.  Thanks a million, Dylan.  You folks 
should discuss whether you want to include the Excel exhibits as I've 
included them in the memo---no pride of ownership, so don't be timid.  Dylan, 
they are formatted for printing, so all you should have to do is print away.  
See you all soon.  

Best,
Jeff

I'd vote to let Hap do it.

Ms Fleming:
No apologies necessary.  Anybody would be confused with what we've thrown at 
you.  Just to be sure, it's David Cox (new Republican leader in the Assembly) 
and John Campbell (Republican Assemblyman).  Can't thank you enough for you 
help.  Hope you had a nice weekend.

Thanks, Lee.  Is there a firmed-up agenda yet?  If so, could you forward to

Jeff --

Some thoughts -

1. Your key assumption seems to be that this Summer the energy supply manager 
(CDWR buying net short of utility) has enough "power" to sell the negawatts.  
I am not so sure.   I belive that a more realistic assumption is that in most 
hours this Summer, CDWR will be buying energy from the ISO.

2. If my assumption is closer to reality, than CDWR will not be able to sell 
"excess" MWs and pay the customer.  Even if you are right, CDWR buys at 
$80/Mwh (LT contracts delivered today) and sells at $300/Mwh = net benefit to 
deliver to customer of $220/Mwh [unless you are saying the $80/Mwh goes to 
retail rates and $300/Mwh to customer = which is what I say in #3].

3. I think that we should just call a spade a spade.  CDWR should give the 
customer for a negawatt $300/Mwh independent of how they manage their 
portfolio.  The $ should be put into the general expense of power and 
collected through CPUC approved rates.  Had the customer consumed, that Mwh 
would have cost CDWR at least $300/Mwh (and probably more given the increased 
load).  The state and/or customers still spends the same $.  The only 
argument that one could have is that the customer who conserves "costs" other 
customers $.  But these other customers should not feel slighted.  Again, 
CDWR was already going to pay the generators.  Why not pay someone who has a 
real business in CA?

4. So let's compute the cost = 

2000 MW x 80 hours [5x16] x $350/Mwh = $56MM for a one month, 2,000 MW 
on-peak curtailment.  

But the other benefit is (a) reliability, (b) less fossil fuel burned = 
cleaner environment, (c) sticking it too those damn greedy generators, and 
(d) probably lower overall prices and costs because lower demand.

Jim

So was his angle, the shareholders should take the $175 and run?

 << File: SCE_Presentation3.ppt >>  << File: ENE Power Costs for Treasury 
Summit4.xls >> 

there was a strong case for that. only thing preventing was the internal DCF 
of the time-warner deal being 183-212 (or something)---so why didn't the 
market put that value on it?  I went with what i thought the flow of the 
group was, but it was a tough row to hoe.  where were you on it?

Hi Anita:
Thanks again for you help with the questions I had about the deals going on 
California.  I'd like to follow-up with you and Steve, particularly regarding 
the "not a telecom" aspect of the deal.  These deals are going to 
accelerate--very confidentially, they are directly linked to getting the 
universe connected to Enron On-line, our very successful B2B website.  I'd 
like to discuss with you two as soon as possible.  Could you let me know when 
a convenient time is?  Thanks a million.

Energy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too 
 Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices 
up. Spokesmen deny any market manipulation. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers

????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels 
that helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and 
fall, according to public and confidential records. 
?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have 
chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into 
darkness and economic chaos. 
?????But they are just part of the equation. 
?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that 
have allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does 
identify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for 
the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized 
profits in the volatile spot market. 
?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a 
recent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently 
trying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville 
Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's 
BC Hydro in British Columbia. 
?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers 
offered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when 
the state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three 
largest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas 
& Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week. 
?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, 
analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in 
the spot, or "real-time," market from May to November. The study accounted 
for factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of 
scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market. 
?????Money earned above that was called excess profits. 
?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits 
as British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show. 
?????"They were the most aggressive bidders," said Anjali Sheffrin, author of 
the coded study. 
?????"They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in," 
said Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name. 
?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive 
profits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private 
generators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy 
Marketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged 
inflated earnings. 
?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they 
played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan 
and did not exploit the state's troubles. 
?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of 
severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise 
overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be 
produced inexpensively but sold for a premium. 
?????"It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity 
would be at any given time," said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. "We 
helped keep the lights on in California." 
?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC 
Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a "rainy day" account to 
ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. 
?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list 
of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices 
during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire 
spot market, where emergency purchases are made. 
?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power 
at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest 
increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them 
from falling. 
?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity 
ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston 
and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy 
market. 
?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that 
could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, 
referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. "The data shows they 
clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load 
conditions." 
?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings 
"outrageous," insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. 
?????"These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes 
unpunished in this state," Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert 
more blackouts across the state. 
?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for 
surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to 
produce. 
?????"We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%," he said. 
"It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down 
their throats." 
?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never 
took it personally. "If you're innocent," he said, "you don't look at the 
criminal file." 
?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's 
deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration, 
a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal 
dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. 
?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but 
reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it 
supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was 
in the top five accused of taking excessive profits. 
?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back 
federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon 
recovery program. 
?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act 
improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached 
its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading 
for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. 
?????"From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we 
operated precisely within the terms of their rules," Oliver said. 
?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so 
distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act 
responsibly, has bailed out. 
?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier 
studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138, 
the highest. 
?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers 
offering power received the highest price paid in any hour. 
?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to 
sell at a single-digit price. 
?????"They weren't the culprits," said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. "Someone else 
drove that up." 
?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California 
market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he 
said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. 
?????"We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw," 
he said. 
?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the 
price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because 
the overall prices are still excessive. 
?????"We're saying the patient is sick," Sheffrin said of California's 
electricity market. "It needs help [and] may die." 
?????

Thank you, Rosalee.

Greetings.  Just checking in to see how Mitch and Carl are doing on the 
proposal.

Greetings:
Joe, I just ran into some El Paso guys that I know (I'm in L.A.) and asked 
them about the Lukens study.  They said that they weren't sure that it had 
been released yet.  They intend to submit it with their testimony in the FERC 
case.

Best,

Joe Hartsoe received a call from Commission staff at FERC to try and 
understand why basis differentials into California were so big and why the 
large basis continues.  Clearly with the new Electricity Order, natural gas 
is one of the primary factors on electricity prices in California.

Our key fear, however small, is that FERC (or someone else) recognizes the 
huge implication of natural gas prices and seeks to cap natural gas sales for 
resale of P/L affiliates (such as ENA).  There is some fear that the real 
monopoly is the holder of LT firm capacity, not the gas production firms.

We need to develop a good story as to why the basis gas continues and 
messaging it quietly into the right FERC staff to keep the pressure of 
additional Investigations from happening.  Joe is trying to get his hands on 
the Lukens study presented to the California study Committee on natural gas 
abuse to help guide our analysis.

RE:         Friday, May 4 meeting at 1:30 pm in the CMTA conference room
to discuss Windfall Profits Tax bills

Due to a scheduling conflict, we are changing our Thursday, 2:00 pm
meeting to Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.

As most of you are aware, CMTA is opposing legislation designed to
impose a Windfall Profits Tax on electricity generator
companies.  The bills are SBX1 1 (Soto) and ABX1 128 (Corbett).  Please
note that the Soto bill pertains to co-generators as
well as entities exclusively in the power business.  That means that
many of you would be directly effected.  The other primary
basis for opposition is that the bills would inhibit electrical supply.
Please also note that, to the extent that SBX1 1 (Soto) were
operative, it would impose the "windfall cost" on business taxpayers who
would fund the credit given to personal income tax
taxpayers.

You are invited to our lobbying strategy meeting which will be here at
CMTA's offices at 980 9th Street, Suite 2200
on Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.  Please RSVP to Pam Ross at 916-498-3320 or

On April 20, 2001, SCE filed Advice 1534-E-A with the Commission.

Title:
Establishment of Four New Balancing Accounts and other Tariff Revisions -
Supplemental Filing

Purpose:
This advice filing establishes four separate balancing accounts: 1) the SCE
Utility Retained Generation Balancing Account; 2) the SCE Contracts
Balancing Account; 3) the Procurement Costs Balancing Account; and 4) the
Ancillary Services Balancing Account.  In addition, this filing dedicates a
portion of SCE's residually determined generation rate and
Commission-approved surcharges between the four balancing accounts based on
estimated costs for a twelve-month period and establishes the Generation
Rate Trigger Mechanism. Furthermore, in conjunction with the implementation
of the four new balancing accounts and the Trigger Mechanism, this filing
1) modifies the Transition Revenue Account; 2) establishes the Net
Undercollected Amount Account; (3) eliminates the Transition Cost Balancing
Account; 4) eliminates the Generation Memorandum Accounts 2 ; and 5)
eliminates the Emergency Procurement Surcharge Balancing Account.

Hi TJ:
Work has prevented me from being on campus this week.  I registered for 
1-unit courses, but have not "signed up" in the office.  If that is 
mandatory, please let me know and my girlfriend---a student in the day 
program who will be there today---can sign me up.

Hi,

ONE-UNIT COURSES:
The demand for one-unit courses is very high, as outlined in the Student 
Handbook.  It is uncommon for a student to be given a space in more than 
ONE one-unit course per semester.

If you got into your 1st choice of a 1-unit class for Fall 2001, you will 
not be put on a waitlist for your 2nd choice at this time.  After classes 
start in the Fall, if there is room available in any of the 1-units, we'll 
let you know.  Adds will be based on seniority in the program.

Thanks!
You'll be given a chance to update your schedules May 4 - May 11.
I will e-mail your Fall 2001 schedules to you this Friday.

Thanks!
TJ

As of right now, I'm available, but with the crisis in California, I might be 
called away.  At this point, though, I'm clear and will plan on meeting.  My 
apologies for the uncertainty.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks for the note.  We'll need to to discuss this a bit further, since it 
could be a very sensitive issue for us (e.g., "Enron's answer to the 
electricity crisis in municipalization).  If spun right, could provide an 
interesting opportunity, however.

Jeff

Gentlemen, 

California State Senator Nell Soto (D-Ontario Dist.32) has authored SB 23 X 
which is intended to streamline the formation of public power districts in 
California.  

Here is an opportunity for Enron to get involved and flex some muscle and win 
on several fronts.  I think Enron is uniquely qualified to work with 
municipalities to provide private labeled products or services that will 
create a winning situation for all parties involved (including the IOUs).  

I am extremely interested in working on such an effort and would very much 
enjoy sharing my ideas in more detail at any time.  Please feel free to 
contact me.

Thanks all,

You're welcome, but no need for thanks.  I was just telling it like it is.  
You do a great job for us, and we appreciate it a lot.  I'm going to be up on

Received a call this afternoon from Gordon Smith, CEO of PG&E (I met Gordon 
when he was CFO of PG&E and I was a bureaucrat at the PUC working on the Blue 
Book).  He was following up from the meeting this morning with Bob Glynn.  He 
was very positive about the comprehensive solution that Ken Lay described to 
Glynn at this morning's meeting.  He was particularly positive about the 
core/noncore proposal.  He asked to meet to discuss it further.  I have an 
appointment to meet with him Monday afternoon.  He offered--as a board member 
of the California Chamber of Commerce--to help bring the Chamber along, and 
he also said that he can help with the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Ass.  
I'll report back after the meeting.

And may have already mentioned that I have a meeting scheduled in Sacramento 
Monday with the CEO of the Chamber and the President of CMA.

Will report back on the meetings.  Have a good weekend.

Best,
Jeff

Hi folks:
Well, I ended up traveling ALL week, which I wasn't happy about.  Worse, some 
nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time) deleted 
my entire *&$*(!*-ing hard disk (which stupidly, I hadn't backed up)---year's 
worth of work and school gone, kaputt.  Anyway, if there's any chance that 
someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them to me, I would 
be greatly indebted.  Sorry for the inconvenience, and see you on Monday.

Best,
Jeff

Seems that Fergus' folks should be able to get their hands on it.

one or more of them can get their hands on it.

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Murkowski Challenges Capitalists To Cap Runaway Power Prices In CA

In what some observers believe could be a watershed change in rhetoric, 
Senate energy policy leader Frank Murkowski (R-AK) is berating the capital 
community for not coming forward and detailing what kind of ceiling on 
wholesale power prices it would take to insure adequate generation -- but 
head off continued economic damage to the state of California.

 The criticism signals that the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee has grown impatient with the hail of philosophical 
charges and counter-charges that have followed FERC's April 26 order on the 
California market and is turning elsewhere than FERC for a solution. Sources 
also say it may be a signal that there is a majority on his committee that 
would support some kind of legislative control on the wholesale power market 
in the West.

"I am issuing an admonition to the financial community," Murkowski said at 
the conclusion of a hearing on the recent FERC order. "If the financial 
community will come in and say what terms and conditions they will need to 
bring new generation into the state, we can cut through this chatter."

Among other provisions, the FERC order institutes a plan for price controls 
during Stage 1 and higher power emergencies. Lawmakers at the hearing, 
especially from California and the West, criticized the action as 
insufficient to prevent price gouging.

FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the limited nature of the price controls will 
continue to provide the power industry with incentives to build power plants 
in California.

Murkowski called on financial interests attending the hearing to settle the 
debate.

"Tells us what you will or will not do under a price cap," said Murkowski. 

Murkowski indicated that the answer to his question should come directly from 
top figures in the financial community. 

Murkowski also signaled that Congress may step in and take legislative action 
on the California crisis. 

"We have to question the adequacy of the order and introduce legislation to 
address problems if necessary," Murkowski said.

The sentiment was echoed by other members of the Committee. 

"We cannot allow our government to sit idly by and allow a tragically flawed 
and easily manipulated power market wreak havoc on our economy," Sen. Maria 
Cantwell told Hebert. "If you're not going to take action, Congress is going 
to act."

All three FERC commissioners testified at the hearing but it was Chairman 
Curt Hebert who was on the receiving end of most of the criticism.

"FERC has done a wonderful imitation of a potted plant," Sen. Byron Dorgan 
(D-ND) told Hebert. "Regulation is not a four letter word. The market system 
sometimes gets out of wack.

Commissioner William Massey also criticized FERC's order, and acted as 
counterpoint to Hebert throughout the hearing. Commissioner Linda Breathitt 
defended her support of the April 26 order.

"One thing is clear, you all don't get along very well," observed Dorgan.

"I'm amazed at what's been done," said Murkowski in defending FERC's action 
over the past several weeks. "It's better than nothing."

"I've been disappointed," replied Dorgan. "I hope FERC decides it's a 
regulatory body and steps up and takes some action."

Sen. Feinstein suggested to Hebert that FERC take a closer look at the impact 
of skyrocketing natural gas prices on the exorbitant increase in electricity 
prices in California.

In response, Hebert announced that FERC was holding a technical conference 
May 24 on current and projected natural gas pipelines into California.

"I agree that this is a natural gas situation and we intend to look into this 
as well," Hebert said.

Dear Mr. Dasovich,

They look forward to receiving email from you this afternoon. Marybeth will

Greetings Laura and Marybeth:

Laura:
If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour 
briefing you on the energy situation.  I apologize for the brevity of this 
note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.

In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to 
try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for 
the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of 
center).

The deal would be bi-partisan.

If successful, the deal would:

Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right 
price signals for efficiency, but fall short of "shock therapy."
Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates.
Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the 
solution
Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the 
State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate 
changes.
Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but 
never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large 
industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market.
NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility 
transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal).
Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers.
Resolve the myriad lawsuits, investigations, etc.

Those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of "wise 
persons" to help get the deal done.  L. Summers is willing; others are being 
considered.  Your name has come up.  But that issue can be addressed later.  
The goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events, 
which are breaking quickly.

Hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.  Congratulations on Haas' #7 
ranking in US News and World Report.

Best,
Jeff

Ok - I got home at 7 - made a full dinner (chicken, mashies, arties),
watered all of your new plantings, roughed up your father in a little ping
pong, and then went on a search and destroy mission for those damn frogs.
We got 'em too!   They were two eensy little things that made the most noise

Speaking of cheese, I spoke with Jeff Green last night, and under the 
circumstances, he'd prefer to do the Dome road next summer (when he's up 
doing more work on my property.  I agreed (there's a lot more bark from all 
the wood chopping and that'll get us through till June).  I talked to him 
about the culvert.  He had some thoughts, which I'll pass along and I'll talk 
to him about it some more this weekend.

You got it. I'll leave another one COB.  Hope you're well.

Agree with your suggestion on how to "re-package" the solution.  They should 
write and call legislators and the governor and all sign a document endorsing 
it.

Attached is a letter Marathon drafted to send to the top 100+ CA businesses 
in our database giving them info on our "comprehensive solution."  Rather 
than attach the solution document as is, I'd recommend a shorter, simplified 
version, plus an overview page that answers "What does this do for: 
customers?  the state?  utilities?  marketers/generators?"  

Also, what is it we want these business leaders to do?  Do we want them to 
write/call/weigh-in w/ their legislators and the governor?  Do we want them 
to be signatories on a formal proposal?

Please let me know what you think. 

Thanks.

Hi Karen:

It was good to see you Friday.  I hope you had a nice visit in So. Cal.

I've attached a draft letter to existing list of CEO's from Ken Lay for your
review.  The attached draft letter assumes that the background material from
Jeff will be enclosed and that the sample letter to Gov. Davis, et. al. asks
for support of specific legislation, policies.

If we've got this wrong, let us know and we will try again.

Greetings:

Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California 
Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California 
Chamber of Commerce.

Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally 
supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information 
regarding the core/noncore proposal.  We have a meeting set up for Thursday 
morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.  Stewart will bring 
Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.

Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall 
package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.  Though 
he, too, would like more details.  Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former 
Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business 
Roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing 
we've been urging, i.e., D's and R's need to get together (read "grow up") 
and do a comprehensive deal.

Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with 
him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.

We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support 
and pitch:

1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve 
this now, and 
2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've 
described.   

They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before 
they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly 
didn't reject the idea.

Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.

Best,
Jeff

I'm serious.  Are you referring to the proposal that no one knows about that 
everyone knows about?  We going to celebrate?

My apologies, but Steve's going to be in a meeting with the Governor from 
about 1:30 to 3 PM today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter 
returning to Houston.  Likely best to try to arrange the call for tomorrow, 
if that works with Laura.  I'll check Steve's schedule and forward the 
information to you.

Harry:  

At the meeting yesterday, we concluded that it would be a good idea to take 
the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with EES and use it 
as the "base case" to start running the numbers.  Idea being that before we 
shop anything around, we need to know what the numbers look like to determine 
whether the thing's got any legs.  

Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case  numbers shake out, 
we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the 
variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial 
groups for buy-in.  We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger 
Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look 
like by middle of next week.  How's this plan sound?  Few other points:

We assume that bullet 6's reference to "net" means that the deferral is 
calculated by taking any "overcollections" and subtracting them from any 
"undercollections" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year.
What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date?  We're assuming it's 
commercially driven.  We correct?  If so, what's the driver?  Same goes for 
the 2004 ending date.
Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an "Option 2" 
for folks to consider.  (Though we don't think that any numbers need to be 
run on "Option 2" until after having completed the analysis on option 1, 
since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct).  
Option 2 would:
Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking 
treatment.
Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers "noncore," similar to the gas model in 
California, and force those customers to choose an ESP.
Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining "core" 
(i.e., rez and small commercial) customers.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that 
I want to throw out for folks to react to:

Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down 
and simple as possible. 
When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the 
over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation?
In option 2, by adding the "noncore" feature, and by implementing that 
feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the 
proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the 
utility's position).  This is not to say that the complications can't be 
worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to 
highlight it for folks to consider.

Attached is the original, with just a couple of minor edits, and "Option 2."

Best,
Jeff

SAN FRANCISCO, May 9 (Reuters) - The California Public Utilities Commission 
on Wednesday proposed two plans to increase electricity rates in the 
power-starved state through a tiered retail pricing system.

The parallel plans, submitted by an administrative law judge and CPUC 
President Loretta Lynch, are designed to encourage energy conservation by the 
24 million customers of PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - news) Pacific Gas & Electric 
unit and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news) Southern California Edison 
subsidiary.

Higher rates also would allow the state to begin to recover money from 
utility bills to pay for power it has purchased on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities, Lynch said.

The plans are expected to be voted on Monday by the five-member CPUC. 
Approval would implement the commission's March 27 move to raise retail power 
prices to help recover soaring costs of wholesale power.

The March decision did not specify how the rate increases would affect 
different classes of electric customers.

The plans, announced by Lynch, would raise rates 20 percent to 50 percent for 
commercial and industrial customers, and 41 percent to 48 percent for all 
electricity used by residential customers in excess of a percentage of their 
existing base usage.

Lynch told a news conference, however, that up to half of California's 
residential customers who meet certain conservation targets would not face 
higher rates.

Electricity rate hikes for agricultural customers served by PG&E and SoCal 
Edison would be capped at 23 percent to 30 percent, she added.

Paul Clanon, a CPUC energy director, said the rate plans would raise $5 
billion this year from utility customers, with some of the money channeled to 
the California Department of Water Resources, which is buying electricity on 
behalf of the state.

The CPUC has not decided, however, exactly how much of monthly utility bills 
would flow to the agency.

California's power purchases this year have drained the state treasury of 
some $6 billion.

The state Senate on Wednesday approved a bill to issue $13.4 billion in bonds 
to pay for emergency power and sent the measure to Gov. Gray Davis, who is 
expected to sign it.

The Senate's approval came two days after the state Assembly passed the power 
bond measure as a piece of regular -- rather than emergency session -- 
legislation, meaning California will have to wait at least 90 days to issue 
the debt.

The bond issue aims to repay the state for the power purchases, with the debt 
to be paid off over 15 years through a portion of the monthly utility bills.

FYI. Ken Lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making California be 
quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having 
this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group 
of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).  This is 
the version that we gave to Lay's office; he may have modified it.  Will 
check with Rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes 
were made.

Best,
Jeff

Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea 
(lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them 
regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:

They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power 
purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore ("why should it be mandatory to 
go the market?"), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for 
core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when 
the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) 
should pay for DWR's "past" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core 
customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates 
the core's "net short" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would 
not have to pay for any of DWR's "going forward costs" (since core gets them, 
in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation)
I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects 
would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful 
to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the 
necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment 
until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are 
extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge 
and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the 
Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento 
for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to 
CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to 
commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.

My apologies.  I took a vacation that I was in much need of, and as you know, 
it's more hectic trying to take off on vacation than it is coping with the 
day-to-day mess.  And I came back to utter chaos.   

Regarding my homework assignment, I checked my records and, lo and behold, I 
am completely vested.  

That said, I also thought long and hard about making a switch and came to the 
conclusion that the switch would need to be a significant one in order to 
make leaving a compelling proposition.  Of course, it goes without saying 
that working with you is about as compelling as it gets, but when I stack up 
the other pieces of the puzzle, they seem somewhat less compelling than the 
opportunity to work with you.  It is so enticing.  But it is with extreme 
regret that I am inclined to decline your gracious offer.

Would be happy to discuss it further, and you know without me saying that I 
am honored that you considered me and greatly appreciative.  Give a holler 
when you find a minute.

Best,
Jeff

Dirk/Jay - thanks for the quick response.  I want to insure we have 
accurately portrayed the situation to you both (the real duration of our 
requests, and the real response time of the utilities).  Don't want anyone to 
walk into a response of "..... we've only had that request for XX days....".  
We do need help though if we want to achieve our aggressive schedule.    

We are falling behind our target schedule due to a lack of pulse meter 
contact installations.  How hard would it be to get informal org charts for 
the metering side of SCE, SDGE, and PGE (just simple bob works for jim who 
works for tom who reports to bill), and......, to identify who (within 
Enron/CEC/ISO) has the relationship(s) with those groups?  

The execution side of the boxter effort asked Jay who they could talk to to 
insure we were working "smart" in California with respect to getting interval 
meters modified to include pulse contacts.  The execution team wants to 
insure that we aren't standing in the wrong long line.  We want to know who 
we could/should call to express our "appreciation" for all their cooperation, 
and to insure they knew our aggressive timetable.   How many times have 
you/we heard "........ oh....., that's what you are doing....., if someone 
had just called me........, I could have........".  

The request for "contacts" (and to know the metering org chart inside each of 
these three utilities) was so we could attempt to penetrate those three org's 
(SCE, SDGE, PG&E) at the optimum level.  Additionally - if we have acct mgmt 
folks that have relationships - we want to leverage those.  

Tom - can you provide to those listed above the short exec summary of what we 
have requested from SDGE, SCE, PGE, and...., what their response has been 
(use the attached XLS chart).  Help charactarize when we officially made 
request, so that we provide an accurate perception of the three utility's 
responses.  

Thx

Jeff, we are rolling out a CEC/CALISO curtailment initiative in California 
that provides major benefits to our customers. Before the program can be 
implemented, customer facilities need to be equipped with a pulse generating 
meter (a modified version of a regular meter). As we are no longer the MSP we 
now have to rely on the UDCs to install these meters. We fully expect to pay 
for these installations but we are getting major push back in SCE and PG&E 
territory with respect to scheduling these installations. If we were to go by 
PG&E's schedule (12 weeks), the summer will be over and most benefits will be 
lost.

We are under the impression that Enron is plain dirt in the eyes of the UDC 
employees, and we are being singled out by the rank and file folks as the 
major culprit for the energy crisis. However primitive that opinion is, we 
are stuck with it. Please note Jay Ferry's contention below.

Is there a way for you to nudge some UDC executives and ask them to instruct 
their field crews to start cooperating?  We could use the help.

Dirk,

We have been working with Mike Connaly and his boss, Mel Calais, at SCE to 
expedite deployment of pulse meters.  Do you know the chain of command there 
and if there is anyone higher that we could call if work continues to move 
along at a snail's pace.  Please call me (713-646-7086) or respond by e-mail, 
if you can't reach me.

This is a very good, easily digestible summary of the FERC order.  Alan 
Zaremberg, CEO of the Chamber and located in Sacramento, asked if we had a 
summary that we could provide him.  Zaremberg is convinced that no one in 
California understands what FERC did and wanted to try to educate them.  If 
we sanitize it to remove anything sensitive, are folks comfortable providing 
it to Zaremberg?  Thanks.

yes. in fact, i suggested it. be great to book jim.  thanks.

Marybeth:

I apologize. As I mentioned, this situation is extremely fluid.  I also 
mentioned this morning that in yesterday's meeting w/the Governor, it was 
agreed that the meetings would continue, every day, until the thing got 
resolved.  I was just informed that I've been elected by my management to be 
on today's call (Steve Kean and I will be our representatives).  It starts at 
1PM.  We are scheduled to talk at 2:30 PM.  I'm hoping--but not altogether 
hopeful---that the call will end before 2:30.

I can't apologize enough for the scheduling problems, particularly since I'm 
the one who originated the request to chat with Laura.  

We can do it one of several ways; it's completely your call:  1) play it by 
ear, and I can let you know around 2:15 if I think the call's going to wrap 
up by 2:30.  2) we can reschedule (I would of course very much like to brief 
Laura on what's going on). 3) you can decide it's too much trouble and throw 
up your hands, which I would understand.

Let me know how you 'd like to proceed and please give my sincere apologies 
(and best) to Laura.  I have to get on the call right now, so if you need to 
speak to a live person, give Joseph a call at 415.782.7841.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Alan:

In our ongoing analysis of the MOU, and in our attempt to put together a 
solution for California, we need to do a reality check on the implied curves 
the Governor's consultants are using to arrive at their rate proposals.  To 
ensure an "apples to apples" comparison, we're hoping to get our curve data 
for 24X7 power, averaged on a quarterly basis, from 2001-2010.

Hoping that you can get that for us.  That possible?  Let me know.  Thanks a 
bunch.

Best,
Jeff

1) if he's got 30 minutes, then he should join for 30 minutes.
2) quite urgent, since the analysis needs to be done pronto.
3) if he can't join, that's ok.  we can fill him after the meeting.

Good job.  It's got traction.  Can you call when you get a chance to 
regroup.  thx, jeff

OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch 
some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out 
the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest 
in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is 
the analysis that you're already working on:

Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 
years).
Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the 
short for the core)
Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts 
the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's 
going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs 
attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.

Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Maureen:

Could you ask Steve if he will be able to make the 4:30 (CST) with Laura

SVMG Member Companies:

We URGENTLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT in sending a strong message today and
tomorrow to the
PUC that the proposed rate proposal is unacceptable to SVMG employers, its
workers and families.   We have only until 6 pm this evening to submit
formal comments for the proposed rate structure just this morning. A brief
analysis is below.  Please call or fax the following Public Utilities
Commissioners IMMEDIATELY with our urgent message.  Please and let me know
if you and your organization have done so.

Also, don't forget to avail yourself of one last opportunity to directly
meet with the PUC at a public hearing regarding this rate proposal at the
Doubletree Hotel tomorrow (Friday May 12, 2001) at  3:00, 2050 Gateway

**************

The PUC unveiled their proposal with the following rate allocations:

Residential customers are protected with an average rate increase of 17%,
Small commercial users 45%
Large energy users up to from 50 to 75%.

This does not include the 1 cent rate increase proposed in January which
would increase the large energy users rate by 100%.  A fair and proportiona=
l
rate increase would be an average increase of 34% for all customers.
President Lynch admitted that this may not be enough, and that additional
rate increases could be required in the future.   In protecting the
residential rate classes, the PUC is shifting approximately $1 Billion from
the residential rates to all other customer classes.

It is important that we all SVMG member companies communicate to our PUC
Commissioners the danger of protecting residential rates where the use of
power is more discretionary and flexible than for employers.  Unfairly high
business rates decrease productive electricity use with subsequent loss of
goods and services and JOBS.  Protecting the residential rate class is bad
policy because it guts the incentive for many residents to conserve.

SVMG understands that prices must rise significantly to accommodate the cos=
t
of electricity.  It is regrettable.  But any plan must be equitable and
proportional between all rate classes with no cross subsidization.

The SVMG press release form this morning is below.  The PUC release is in
the link below.

The PUC release.  http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/NEWS_RELEASE/6967.htm

***************
P.U.C. IS A.W.O.L. ON PROPOSED RATE INCREASE=01,S EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY AND
EFFORTS FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSERVATION

For Immediate Release:             Contact: Michelle Montague-Bruno
May 10, 2001                        (408) 501-7853

=01&The disproportional rate increases proposed by the PUC will devastate t=
he
state and potentially the nation=01,s economy,=018 said Carl Guardino, pres=
ident
and CEO of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, in response to
electricity rate increases being suggested by the Public Utilities
Commission (PUC) and its President Loretta Lynch.

The PUC president=01,s proposal has three critical flaws:
1.   It undermines the Governor and the Legislature=01,s conservation plan;=
 which
already tilts heavily toward residential customers, because the PUC proposa=
l
provides individuals with no incentives to conserve.
2.   It is devastating to California=01,s economy; which will cripple Calif=
ornia
companies and every working family that depends on a healthy business
climate to maintain jobs.
3.   Coupled with the economic downturn California employers already face,
this Commission is either insensitive or ignorant to the further loss of
jobs this proposal could create.

=01&The PUC may think that by shielding residential customers from paying o=
ur
proportionate share that they are doing everyone a favor; yet it=01,s prett=
y
hard to pay your bills when a disproportionate plan forces your employer ou=
t
of business or out of California,=018 said Guardino.

Yesterday, the PUC proposed raising rates for some employers by 50 to 75
percent, which would be the second increase handed to the industrial
business community this year.  For many employers, the recently proposed
rate increases will equate to a 100 percent increase in electric bills in
less than five months.

=01&This is irresponsible behavior at a time when the state=01,s economy is
already reeling from an economic downturn that has hurt employers and lost
jobs for working families,=018 said Guardino.

=01&Many companies, including Roche Pharmaceuticals, have had very aggressi=
ve
energy reduction programs in place for several years, which will continue.
To further cut consumption - in order to pay for a non-proportional and
destructive rate increase -- for some employers, could mean cutting into
their workforce, or leaving the area all together,=018 said Dr. James Woody=
,
President of Roche Pharmaceuticals R&D in Palo Alto and Chairman of the
Board of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group.  =01&We want to do our fai=
r
share in paying for rate increases, but the disproportionate nature of this
proposal could be devastating to employers. We need a rate structure that
will allow employers to thrive and help pull us out of this economic
downturn.=018

The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group understands and acknowledges the nee=
d
to raise electric rates to help minimize blackouts, which will protect the
public=01,s health and safety.  However, to achieve desired conservation an=
d
fairness, it is essential that all Californians share proportionally in rat=
e
adjustments.

=01&Proportional rate increases should be implemented with no rate shifting
between classes of energy users.  Member companies of SVMG are committed to
being part of the solution, as we work together to conserve power, retain
our workforce and ensure a healthy economy,=018 said Guardino.

=01&Apparently, the PUC is out of touch with working families, conservation=
 or
jobs in California,=018 said Guardino.  =01&It=01,s a naive proposal.  It a=
ssumes we
can put a firewall between working families and jobs their employers
provide; but instead this notion threatens the livelihoods of California
workers and businesses.=018

So does this mean we're right where we left off with respect to status of 
bills like wind-fall profits, jails for generators, etc.?

At the request of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and Senate
Minority Leader Jim Brulte, the Senate desk has arranged for the
preparation of all First Ex bills for reintroduction as Second Ex bills,
retaining the same numbers. These measures will be redrafted in their
last First Ex version or, in the case of those already having reached
the Assembly, in the form in which they left the Senate.

It is the intention of the President Pro Tem to move all measures in the
new extraordinary session to the same place they remained at the end of
the first extraordinary session.

It's pretty clear the both Lynch and the ALJ are at one end of the spectrum
and
that both advocate disproportionate increases for large industrial
customers.   Keep in mind that the percentage increases for interruptible
customers would be even larger than these class average figures.  Bill Booth

Jeff,

Please check with Belden or I if you are going to use these curves for 
anything other than internal analysis or high-level negotiating.

If you need help converting into quarterly numbers, let me know.

Remember that the total cost of wholesale power includes ancillary services 
which you can estimated to be 5% of these amounts.  I.e., 105% of the curve 
price is the average power cost including A/S

The world is mighty small.  As an undergrad at Berkeley, I worked as a 
paralegal at Brobeck.  One of the "associates" I reported to was, you guessed 
it, Gary Fergus. Haven't seen him since.  Will be interested to compare notes.

	MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com>
	09/29/2000 06:26 PM
		 
Today, Friday, Gary Fergus of the Brobeck firm and I met with Attny. Harvey
Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the
five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We
negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an
opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of
the request for production of documents.   This will include a further
extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a
reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We
are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in
Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections.

However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and
senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications,
Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with
the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the
overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme
pressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what was
happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "many
parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the
Governor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing
responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of
cooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" which
would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such
parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.

This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC.
I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never
invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so
by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded
that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply
trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery
requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment
speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve
a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron
officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this
incident.

Mike Day

materials now. jeff

This looks fantastic.  I apologize profusely. I've got a dozen assigments to

Ken -- Thank you for making next Thursday, May 17 available for CEO meetings 
in California.  We are working to set up two meetings -- one in Los Angeles 
and one in Silicon Valley (we'll call on Scott McNealy's contact person to 
help pull the Northern California meeting together).   For the Los Angeles 
meeting, we'd like you to call Mayor Dick Riordan (213-847-3560) and ask for 
his help in pulling together a group of key, influential business leaders.   
As background, Riordan is a very wealthy Republican businessman who has been 
term-limited out and has not yet made public his future political aspirations 
(a bid for governor has been mentioned by insiders).

You might congratulate him on helping to settle the Writer's Guild strike and 
ask if he'd now like to resolve the energy crisis (He's in a bit of a spat 
with Dave Freeman over who can claim credit for LADWP's success during this 
energy situation -- see attached LA Times article).  You can say you've been 
told that he was one of the clearer heads during the deregulation process and 
were instrumental in keeping DWP out of the regulatory mess.

This is an opportunity for Riordan to help broker a solution, and that's why 
you're calling him.  You met with Robert Day (Trust Co of the West) who 
suggested that you call Riordan and enlist his support.  

Explain about our comprehensive solution -- business support is critical to 
garner political support.

You'll be in Los Angeles next Thursday.  Ask if he could invite and host a 
meeting of key business leaders and introduce you.  I've attached a suggested 
list of prominent businessmen, close associates and personal friends of 
Riordan's.  We'd like to position this meeting as an insider's conversation 
of what's going on with the energy situation.  This meeting should be for 
principals only.

Ask Riordan to identify someone in his office who we can work with to set up 
the meeting.  Enron's consultant in LA (Marathon Communications) will work to 
coordinate the event.

If Riordan is not available next Thursday, ask him if he would ask Eli Broad 
(chairman of Sun America and a Democratic billionaire) or Jerry Perenchio 
(chairman of Univision) to host the meeting.

Proposed Invitees

*Eli Broad - Chairman, Sun America
*Ron Burkle - Yucaipa Companies
Jeffrey Katzenberg - DreamWorks
Sherry Lansing- Paramount
Nelson Rising- Catellus
Bob Daly - LA Dodgers
Ray Irani - Occidental Petroleum
*Jerry Perenchio - Univison

Riordan and Freeman's Feud Erupts in Public 
Power: Each questions the other's role in keeping the city free of 
California's energy crisis. 
By MICHAEL FINNEGAN, TERENCE MONMANEY, Times Staff Writers

?????With California mired in energy troubles, Mayor Richard Riordan and his 
former power chief S. David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Los 
Angeles: no rate hikes and no blackouts. 
?????Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by 
waging bitter campaigns to discredit each other--at first behind the scenes 
but now in public. 
?????Pettiness, ingratitude, conflicts of interest, overblown claims of 
achievement: Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to 
have good reason to pat each other on the back. 
?????To Freeman, who has resigned as general manager of the L.A. Department 
of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov. Gray Davis, it 
seems Riordan resents his high-profile role in trying to steer California out 
of the energy crisis. 
?????So the mayor, Freeman charged, has elbowed his way into energy issues 
that he is ill-equipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could 
harm the environment. 
?????"With all due respect, I have 25 years of experience and knowledge--and 
he has 25 days," Freeman said. "But he's the mayor, and he didn't like it 
that I didn't just say yes to everything he came up with." 
?????To Riordan, Freeman's efforts to fight air pollution have given short 
shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles. The mayor 
said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between 
his city and state roles in the power crisis. And he scoffed at Freeman for 
saying he had lifted morale at DWP. 
?????"Morale was terrible under him," Riordan said. "I mean, they are so 
relieved right now." 
?????The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about 
egos. City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud, 
successful men unable to say, "I couldn't have done it without X, Y and Z." 
?????"Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being 
recognized as the boss," she said. 
?????Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings. And the mayor, 
a Republican multimillionaire, has taken pains to play down his dispute with 
Freeman, a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks 
with a Southern drawl. 
?????In an interview after his resignation, Freeman laid out the conflict 
point by point, often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor. One of his 
concerns, Freeman said, was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor 
could reverse the agency's progress in protecting the environment. 
?????Freeman cited Riordan's plans concerning coal-fired power plants in 
Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP, the nation's largest 
municipal utility. The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, 
Nev., a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that 
shrouds the Grand Canyon. The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant, 
but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale. 
?????He described the mayor's move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees 
on the board that oversees DWP were "completely insensitive to the fact that 
that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the 
West." 
?????"I've worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity 
into the DWP policy," Freeman said. "And I am concerned as to whether the 
current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity, and what they 
might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress we've made." 
?????The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central 
Utah. Riordan has proposed building a new coal-fired generating unit there, 
but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause. 
?????In both cases, Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance 
between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los 
Angeles at an affordable cost. By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and 
expanding the Utah plant, Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes 
of natural gas--and the sharp rise in ratepayers' bills that would follow, 
Riordan said. 
?????Natural gas, which provides 26% of the fuel for DWP plants, causes less 
air pollution than coal, which provides 51%. The rest is mainly nuclear and 
hydroelectric. Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part 
because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power 
providers. 
?????"I favor clean air and more natural gas, but not to the point where 
we're going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles," Riordan said. 
?????On the Mohave plant, Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the 
city's share to a buyer that would simply continue running it. 
?????"It's still going to be coal-driven," he said. "How does selling it help 
the environment?" 
?????The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis 
has worsened. With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage 
in stories on how L.A. has dodged the crisis, Riordan and the DWP 
commissioners began to view him as "too big for my britches," Freeman said. 
?????The conflict reached its peak on April 17, the day Freeman resigned to 
become the governor's advisor. The DWP board president, Kenneth T. Lombard, 
said the mayor told commissioners that day that "it made the most sense to 
release him immediately." 
?????"All we were doing, frankly, was release him from his responsibilities, 
and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us," 
Lombard said. 
?????From Riordan's standpoint, Freeman needed to be stripped of his 
authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest: The city 
utility sells surplus power to the state, so Freeman would be on both sides 
of the sales. 
?????Freeman, who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state 
power crisis earlier that day, was outraged at his sudden release, in part 
because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees. In an 
interview, he called the conflict of interest assertion "complete malarkey." 
?????"The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the 
interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous, considering 
what I've accomplished here," he said. 
?????Brian D'Arcy, who heads the union local that represents 6,000 DWP 
employees, agreed that Riordan and his commissioners "kind of ran him out of 
here. For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a 
howdy-do is absolutely tacky," D'Arcy said. 
?????Riordan said Freeman deserves "an A-plus" for his work at DWP. The mayor 
conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done "to hurt Los Angeles." 
But, he added, "when you have a conflict of interest, you have to act before 
anything happens." 
?????Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP, not just by the mayor, 
but by the agency's board and the City Council. In 1998, he called for City 
Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of 
directors. The proposal went nowhere. 
?????Freeman's concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday. The 
Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP. It calls for 
restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed. But Riordan and 
Galanter, who chairs the Council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, rejected the concept. Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times

Michael:  did we decide to use the PUC's load numbers?  I would worry about 
that (particularly since we use the MOU QF/IOU gen numbers).  I suggest that 
we use the MOU load numbers for the three utilities, since the PUC numbers 
seem real screwy e.g., they have PG&E's load being smaller than Edison.

FYI, another arrow in our quiver:

? Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another 
downgrade.  Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed 
California that "the only way the state will improve its credit rating and 
look better to investors is to get out of the power business and resolve the 
undercollected."

Bibi's the man---he's the guy I mentioned when we discussed the other night.

Hi:  O lord.  You know, the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have 
time to think about things and absorb it.  But work has gotten so insane that 
I sympathize with your plight (since mine's the same).  I think I've maybe 
made it to 1/2--that's 1/2--of the finance classes.  

NORTH of Sacramento.  Are you driving to Sacramento every day?  Say it ain't 
so.  That's brutal.  

When you say full time, you mean school full time?  That, I assume, means 
leaving your job?  Be happy to talk about it.  You know me---believer in 
always keeping all options open and active.  If full time makes sense, you 
ought to do it.

Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'll be missing class (again) on Tuesday 
because I have to be in Portland.  If you're not going to Sac on Monday, 
coffee in SF during work hours works.  Or I could meet you during break on 
Monday.  Or we could have lunch or a beer after work on Thursday or Friday 
when I'm back from Portland.

Hang in there.  I was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground 
again.  Remember, life's too short to get too worried about it.  Let me know 
what works for you.

Best,
Jeff

PS  I'm spending my Saturday nite working on a financial reporting case.  
Hope that's modest consolation.

"Strategizing?!"   (I don't think so.)

company, the learning, the work, the teams, the
people, the career opportunities.  I hate the 4+ hours
of driving on Mondays and Tuesdays, strategizing(real
word?) about balancing the needs of the team with

thoughts.  Are you available at break on Tuesday for a
beer?

can we use the MOU total load numbes (e.g., 93 GWH for PG&E) and divide it up 
using the proportions in the PG&E numbers?

Greetings Piper:

My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.  I think 
you've spoken with Karen Denne.  Scott asked for some background materials on 
our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.  I'll be forwarding 
those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.  Does that work for you?

Note that SCE does not list the information in their SEC disclosures but 
Robert had some 1999 figures.   Comparing PGE at the sales level, they were 
at 79.2 mln MWH in 1999 versus 78.2 for SCE in 1999.    This leads me to 
believe the 93 mln for PGE and 83 million for SCE in the MOU slide is flat 
wrong on the PGE figure.   We will need to resolve this.

Nancy Rivera-Brooks of the LA Times just called.  Said she'd heard that Ken 
Lay and Governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of Enron 
buying Edison's transmission system.  I told her that Enron is not in the 
market for transmission systems.  Next thing you know, we'll want to buy the 
nukes.

Ken Smith mentioned that Dave Parquet sent out an email about this issue -- 
do either of you have a copy of it?  If so, please forward to me.  Thanks! kd
I spoke with Elain Cory from San Francisco's NPR bureau, who  called Hedy 
Govenar's office earlier today regarding a story she's doing on  plant siting 
and air emission laws.? She's in Sacto today (currently  meeting with IEP), 
but I told her that our experts are in SF rather than  Sacramento.? I also 
told her I was checking with you to see if we could  offer someone (Dave 
Parquet seems the logical choice); if he (or someone else)  is available, she 
can meet with him on Monday.? 
?
Give me a call ASAP so I can follow up with her or so you can  take the 
appropriate steps.? I'll probably be on my cell -- (916)  947-0927.
?
Thanks,

Kenny's comments are absolutely false or, at best,  grossly misleading.  We 
need to respond to him.

The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed 
power plant developments is securing ERCs.  My discussions with Calpine 
indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well.  (And in case someone 
hasn't noticed, the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and 
Calpine.)  Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down, and slowing 
others down, which keeps the new, cleaner plants from being developed.  As I 
have mentioned before, this is actually making air quality worse in that the 
older, dirtier plants are running more.  Further, if you do the math, we will 
probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty 
plants in business because of grandfathering, while the clean plants don't 
get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs.    

Having said that, I do not agree that we should send a message that we want 
to relax or suspend the standards.  (However, getting 2ppm plants on line, 
which will put out of business the 100+ppm plants - as Calpine indicated to 
me happened in Texas - makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension 
is the environmentally appropriate thing to do.)  All in all, though, I 
believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California 
because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public 
will make sure that we pay for such a message.  Having said that, I will 
repeat the key things that we should be promoting, in my opinion:  1.)  stop 
the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of 
insanity.  (GE will not guarantee the present, and new, EPA requirement of 
2ppm, which EPA "determined" with no new operating data.  They just did it 
because they could.)  2.)  Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments.  (Kelly 
Brodbeck is working very hard, for example, to develop a program in the Bay 
Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs.  A high 
level staff guy at BAAQMD "believes" that we should be RACT adjusted, 
probably making the program uneconomic.  There isn't even unanimity for this 
position on his staff.  However, this position if it sticks is irresponsible 
in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are 
doing.  We are creating ERCs, which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in 
their haircut, and in using the ERCs, we will eventually put out of business 
the dirtier plants.  So, our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets 
dirtier...)  3.)  Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying 
ERCs.  There is precedent for that, but this has to be run through the SIP 
and the EPA.  Again, the in-lieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC 
developments (e.g., electric lawn mowers, electric water heaters, etc.), 
which will clean the air.  I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA 
legislature on this.  Go Sandy!

California regulators told congressional lawmakers on Thursday that clean air 
regulations are not to blame for the state's electricity shortages and said 
new legislation seeking to ease air quality rules was unneeded. 
Speaking at a House Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing, the 
head of the California Air Resources Board repeatedly said environmental 
regulations should not be suspended for the sake of electricity. 
"Air quality laws are not interfering with California's ability to bring new 
generation on line and run existing power plants at maximum capacity," said 
Michael Kenny, executive officer of the board. 
When asked by Democratic lawmakers on the panel about a provision in a 
pending electricity bill, the California regulator said the state did not ask 
for a relaxation of clean air rules and did not need the change. 
"We believe that air quality-related sections of the legislation are 
unnecessary," Kenny said. 
Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who chairs the energy subcommittee, 
said the measures allow flexibility to states for the temporary suspension of 
environmental laws. He said the key point of his bill is to ensure the lights 
stay on in California this summer. 
The Golden State expects to face threats of blackouts starting this month, 
when air conditioning use accelerates. 
Objections raised by Kenny to the Barton bill included disagreement on a 
section allowing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to waive, when 
asked by a state, the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to 
nitrogen oxide emissions. 
Kenny said the state already gives flexibility on the issue and contended the 
legislation would go too far and be problematic. 
"The waiver applies to all new generation facilities in the state and does 
not allow for consideration on a case-by-case (generating plant by generating 
plant) basis, where unique local factors can be weighed," said Kenny. 

It'll be to you in about 10-15 minutes.

Attached is additional background on the solution that Ken Lay discussed 
today and that Enron is proposing as a comprehensive solution to California's 
electricity crisis.  If you have any  questions, don't hesitate to contact me

Thanks.  That certainly puts things in perspective.

You're much too kind.  Thanks for the feedback.  My brains just about spilled

coincidentally i did see governor backbone on the show.  i don't think that 
we can count on him toning it down anytime soon, which will not be helpful in 
getting a solution out here.

As some of you may know, President Bush is scheduled to visit St. Paul 
Minnesota on Thursday to tour the city's District Energy system and to give a 
"major speech on energy policy".  District Energy is a facility which heats 
and cools 75% of the downtown buildings and is converting part of its system 
to burn renewable wood biomass.  St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman headed George's 
presidential campaign in MN.

It is believed that Spence Abraham and Christi Nicolay will be accompanying 
him on the trip.

They are also scheduled to visit another plant in Iowa on Thursday.

I'll be on the call.  Hope all's well on your end.

Team,
Let's shoot for Tuesday, May 15, at 2:00 p.m. CDT, 12: 00 noon, PDT.  Mark, 
we'll call you.  Jeff, I don't know if you're available, but if you've got a 
spare minute, it'd probably be a good idea for us to rally by phone before 
the Hearing.  Glen, I'll call you also.

Kim, Steve, if you guys want to sit-in, we'll make the call from one of the 
offices. 

 

Jeff, I am available Tuesday 12 noon to 1:30 pm or first thing Wednesday
morning or almost all afternoon Wednesday. Monday , I am traveling. Mark,
IGS    Have a great weekend.

I saw "the event" re-reun on local cable access TV (randomly viewed on 
Saturday).  It was not pretty and Jeanne did a great job of remaining calm 
and exceedlingly professional---and what a camera presence!  Unfortunately, I 
wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers, but a large bouquet is certainly in 
order.

being very thoughtful on Friday?

Thank you very much.

Greetings:
As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East.  
As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background 
and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during 
his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.  McNealy and others 
have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try 
to advance the ball.

I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all 
errors, omissions, ramblings, etc.  Wanted to distribute, however, to make 
sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.  Know folks are busy, 
but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any 
comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.

Jeff

The four leaders of both houses are meeting in the speaker's office this
afternoon to discuss ways to solve the energy crisis.  I left a meeting
with the Speaker to vacate the room for the leadership meeting, which
was described to me by the Speaker's Chief of Staff as preliminary to a
global solution, if one is achievable.  I have a scheduled meeting with
one of the leaders later today at which time I hope to get feedback on
any progress.

I can make either time.  Just let me know.

Jeff:  We are going to have a call with OPIC tomorrow to discuss the turbine 
export issue and the state of affairs in the California re power.  The two 
times that OPIC people are available are 11:30-2:00 and 4:30-5:30 (both times 
are eastern standard time).  Does one of these slots appear better for you?  
I don't anticipate that you would be needed for the entire time allotted for 
the call but I'm sure the OPIC people will have some questions requiring your 
knowledge of California.  Attached, please find a summary document we're 
working on containing talking points we want to convey to OPIC.  Again, 
thanks for your help, Scott

It was a beautiful day (and evening).  Congratulations to you both.  It is a 
very sweet thing for two very sweet people, and I'm sort of choked up for 
being asked to be in the wedding party.  It was a great day for everybody.  
Congratulations.

Best,
Jeff

Beware, the mighty reefer....

Maureen:

Few things.  I was on the call with Steve today and he asked me to do a 
couple of things.

1) Send a summary of today's call to the email list that you've put 
together.  I've got the list from the note you forwarded to me with the 
call-in info for today's call.  Is that the complete list?  If not, could you 
foward me the most recent one, which I'll use to distribute the summary?

2) Could you set up another call for this Friday (May 18th) for 60 minutes at 
10 CDT/8 AM PDT, and distribute to the same bunch of folks that were on 
today's call?  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff

If  California businesses are to have any chance to avoid being forced to 
endure  unbelievable rate increases under the CPUC plan, they must have 
direct  access.? Subcommittee Chairman Barton has told us he supports DA, and 
we  have several California congressmen considering introducing the DA 
amendment at  this Friday's full committee markup.? Please contact ALL 
members that you  can.? Mr. Radanovich, Mr. Ose, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Cox and Mr. 
Shadegg(Arizona)  have all expressed positive interest, but none has given 
the firm committment  necessary to introduce the amendment.? Use the 
telephone, the fax, e-mail,  and any other method you can to convince the

Plz call.  Any numbers yet?  Skilling talking to Gov today?   415.782.7822.

Got a message from PG&E.  Open season will be for 2003 and beyond and they'll 
be accepting bids up to 30 years.  Will talk to PG&E and get back with more 
information.  If you having any questions give a holler at 415.782.7822.

FYI--unless I'm mistaken, the assignment that Steve gave Mike was a very 
quick and dirty analysis as I recall, i.e., should by no means be the tail 
that wags the dog.

P.S.  I eye-balled Mike's numbers, below.  Looks like about $75K for three 
months.

Best,
Jeff

Recall that we terminated all retainers with Mike at the end of April and 
have no RCR approval for Mike for work in May.  

I called Mike and yelled at him for assuming he can work on issues with 
Sandy's approval but without RCR approval.  I called Sandi and she will 
present a number of RCRs--see below.  

I don't think we need Mike's help on windfalls profits--our position is clear 
and the research is done.  
Today and tomorrow, he's participating in two meetings with the Direct Access 
Coalition at my request to support the language we (read "he") drafted.   We 
should get Leslie more integrated on this effort--but will not be able to 
completely reduce Mike's work.

I'm really not sure what to do on power plant siting.  

Also, I'm not sure what we should do about the Global Settlement stuff.  
Apparently, Steve has already requested that Mike do some work on an issue 
(how to insert a poison pill--if the Global Settlement is upset by litigation 
or an AG indictment??).  I am very concerned that we may lose control over 
the issues or the forum unless we centralize the assignments in Jeff or 
Steve.   

Here are my proposals for RCRs related to legal services in support of Enron
legislative activities for May 2001 and the remainder of the session.  These
estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only, and do not represent a
commitment or a "not to exceed" figure for Goodin, MacBride.  The actual
fees incurred may exceed these estimates, and GMSRD will bill Enron on a
hourly fee basis, as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first
part of this year.

1.  Direct access legislation:   This involves working on a continuing
series of bills related to direct access.  I cannot estimate a specific
amount for the entire legislative project, it depends on how long it takes
for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation.   My
best estimate is $8,000 per month, or $24,000 over three months.  The
estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the session's
last month--August.  As of May 11, 2001, we have recorded approximately
$3000 in billings related to direct access in this month.

2. Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset
legislation:   $15,000 over three months, more if the final legislative
solution is delayed until August.  We have recorded approximately $1,000 in
billings related to this area this month (through May 11, 2001).

3. Windfall profits tax bill:  This project required additional upfront
legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax.  We have
billed legal fees for approximately $4000 in May, 2001, up through May 11.
My best estimate is $18,000 over three months of session, more if the bill
is still alive in August.

4. Global settlement/Edison MOU/Plan B legislation:   This project
covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the
energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve
the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the
Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as "Plan B".  As explained
by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near
term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future.
Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but
I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is
still being enacted in August.  We have recorded approximately $2000 in
billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month.

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  We
are pleased to have the opportunity to be of service to Enron, and look
forward to continuing this relationship.

Goodin, MacBride, Squeri, Ritchie & Day, LLP

Great suggestions.  Thanks so much for the help.

Greetings:
n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to 
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't 
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on 
the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of 
the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops.
Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible 
process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution.
It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan B is 
a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to 
the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a 
copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.
Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on 
Friday.
Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency 
level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:  The Credit Issue
Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.  
Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California 
PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for 
power services delivered.  
If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  

Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.
Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The 
following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a 
starting point for discussion.
Utility creditworthiness
retail rates must reflect costs
Increase supply
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
Decrease demand
establish real-time pricing
implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
Create a real market
Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; 
approximately 3-6 months)
Return the procurement role to the utilities
Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for 
electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas
Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, 
etc. 
Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

I will set up a call for Friday and will get back with you and the others 
regarding the call in number, etc.

Maureen:

Few things.  I was on the call with Steve today and he asked me to do a 
couple of things.

1) Send a summary of today's call to the email list that you've put 
together.  I've got the list from the note you forwarded to me with the 
call-in info for today's call.  Is that the complete list?  If not, could you 
foward me the most recent one, which I'll use to distribute the summary?

I already lost it with both Sandy and Mike yesterday.  

Sandy will be preparing three or four RCRs for discussion at the next RCR 
meeting.  In the meantime, on an emergency basis, I've authorized Mike to 
participate in two Direct Access meetings and one conference call with the 
author of the environmental dispatch legislation.   Sandy assured me that the 
environmental dispatch legislation would (if passed) gut the gains we made in 
the siting legislation recently passed.  

On a going forward basis, one of the RCRs will be re:  the global 
settlement.  I think it is critical that Mike report to Jeff on all matters 
relating to the global settlement whether they are legislative or not.  I'm 
drafting an e-mail that I will distribute this afternoon after you have had a 
chance to look at it that should clarify matters.  

Jeff- even if Steve ignores the RCR process, you and Paul have responsibility 
for cleaning up behind him and making sure we don't have Mike doing any more 
than he absolutely needs to . Thanks.

FYI--unless I'm mistaken, the assignment that Steve gave Mike was a very 
quick and dirty analysis as I recall, i.e., should by no means be the tail 
that wags the dog.

P.S.  I eye-balled Mike's numbers, below.  Looks like about $75K for three

billings related to this area this month (through May 11, 2001).

3. Windfall profits tax bill:  This project required additional upfront
legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax.  We have
billed legal fees for approximately $4000 in May, 2001, up through May 11.
My best estimate is $18,000 over three months of session, more if the bill
is still alive in August.

4. Global settlement/Edison MOU/Plan B legislation:   This project
covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the
energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve
the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the
Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as "Plan B".  As explained
by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near
term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future.
Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but
I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is
still being enacted in August.  We have recorded approximately $2000 in
billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month.

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  We
are pleased to have the opportunity to be of service to Enron, and look
forward to continuing this relationship.

Wow.  Don't worry about it.  Have a great time in Montana.  It will be 
gorgeous up there.  You're camped out in Roseville?  You don't deserve that, 
Courtney.  Good idea to find out when the deadlines are.  When you get back, 
give a call and we can meet at break or have lunch or a beer after work or 
something.  Considering your options and keeping them open is a great idea 
and the right thing to do.  Don't stress too much.  Good luck and can't wait 
to hear about Big Sky.

Looks unlikely that we'll get to catch up this week. 
I'm attempting to get to Big Sky, Montana for a
fantastic wedding weekend with my family, (Cousin
getting married).  Hopefully leaving on Thursday-we'll
see what my onsite manager says about it tomorrow. I'm
skipping class tomorrow night.
And I am working every day for the next month up in
the Roseville, land o' HP.  I'm staying up here,
commuting to school-which is what's killing me. 
Plus-I have this increasing concern that I'm not
actually absorbing an MBA's worth of learning and
experiences. Alas-I'll tell you all about it when we
talk.  I sent Diane an email to get the deadlines,
etc.   Have a great time in Portland.  1/2 of the
classes?  dangerous!!

Enron will very vigorously support the CS and I would hope that we could get 
as many people as possible to do the same.  Let's face it, California's gas 
industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess 
(despite, and perhaps contrary to, the substantially more narrow reasoning 
offered by the Brattle Group).  The CS is a well-thought-out, well-designed 
program for moving forward; unlike the "interim," which takes two steps 
back.  Can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call 
them and try to get them to show up in support?

Jeff

Watson has asked for time to speak.  I'm planning to continue to support the
CS.  It brings some greater stability and certainty to SoCalGas' noncore
rates.  The allocation of backbone capacity might improve shippers'
certainty of being able to move gas through Topock and Wheeler Ridge.  In
the short term, it's hard to say how much that might help prices, but I
doubt that it would make them worse.  In the longer term, if new generation
on the PG&E and Kern / Mojave systems, plus the North Baja and Questar
lines, actually reduce SoCalGas' throughput, then a SoCalGas city-gate
market might be pretty competitive.  Finally, the CS removes SoCalGas'
favorite argument in favor of the peaking rate.

So what are Edison and Enron going to do?

Jeff,

Sorry I was unable to make the call yesterday.  Thanks for the summary.  My
comments and questions are indicated below.

Please fax a copy of Plan B to be at 713 767 6677.

     You suggest starting the "process" in Sacramento next week.  I'm not
     sure exactly what this means.  Are we saying we will have a proposal
     or that we will be advocating a process/forum to get all the right
     parties at the table?
     Did we set a time for the next call on Friday?
     With regard to the Issues list, here are a few extra items:
          need to make clear that real price signals should be sent to all
          sectors (not just those that wouldn't vote for Davis anyway) as
          soon as possible
          I cannot imagine a situation in which the IOUs are returned to
          financial stability within 3-6 months; my guess is that it will
          be at least a year
          if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we need to make
          sure that they have the appropriate risk management tools
          (ability to enter forward contracts, options, etc.)
          if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we also need to
          have assurances that the situation we have today won't happen
          again;  for example, if the state assigns the CDWR contracts to
          the IOUs and three years from now the market price is less than
          the contract price, what assurances does anyone have that the PUC
          will not try to make the IOUs absorb the difference
          If we want to go to a core/non-core approach, why do we need to
          wait 18-24 months;  it seems to me that we could start that
          process now
          As for legal claims and investigations, we need to make clear
          that we want to resolve all state and federal claims;  the civil
          claims present a different set of challenges for resolution
          as for discounts on receivables, I'm not ready to commit one way
          or another; however, if there are discounts they must apply to
          all market participants - not just the ones that Davis can get to
          the table.

Lynn

Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com on 05/14/2001 08:47:31 PM

Greetings:
n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were
on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed
anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
   Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael
   Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
   On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed
   that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
   A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would
   take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy
   makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops.
   Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible
   process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face,
   for however long it takes to work out a resolution.
   It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning
   of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
   It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to
   be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
   There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan
   B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an
   alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that
   call I received a copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me
   your fax number.
   Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in
   meeting on Friday.
   Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings
   agency level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of
   the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state
   seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:       The Credit Issue
   Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start
   tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.
   Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by
   the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the
   California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR
   gets paid for power services delivered.
   If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.

Item #2:       Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
   It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's
   meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a
   comprehensive solution.
   Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The
   following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive,
   but a starting point for discussion.
     Utility creditworthiness
        retail rates must reflect costs
     Increase supply
        streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
     Decrease demand
        establish real-time pricing
        implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
     Create a real market
        Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible
        (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to
        creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months)
        Return the procurement role to the utilities
        Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
        Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for
        electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural
        gas
     Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
        Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission,
        generation, etc.
     Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
        Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding
        that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

How's this look?

Thanks.  I'll get you one more name then.  

FYI:  To use a Kaufman phrase, "I'm a little frosted."  I'm on a litigation 
call, on which I mentioned the Plan B (which I got only because I searched 
out Scott Governor yesterday).  On the call Sandi said, "Jeff, there's a 
response from the Governor to the Plan B, which I faxed to Steffes 
yesterday."  I want you to know that I took a deep breath, and asked Sandi to 
fax it to the San Francisco office.  Unreal....

Thanks Robert:
One caution.  It's important that the first-cut analysis be "simple" and 
uses, to the maximum extent possible, the MOU numbers and modeling.  This 
allows us to explain a complex situation to people who aren't necessarily 
"numbers oriented" and to do so with an "apples-to-apples"  comparison.  
That's not to say that we won't be doing scenarios--we will--but it's 
important to have, at the outset, the cleanest, simplest version of "here's 
what core/noncore looks like when we apply your numbers to your model."  That 
said, I understand that even with the simple base case, some tweeks are 
likely.   Talk to you in an hour.  Thanks again for the help.

Best,
Jeff

The CPUC decision on rate design should be used to develop the core rate 
comparison.  That decision has not been issued yet, but it may happen today.  
It would take the form as the schedules that have been previously used, but I 
think we can use a more summarized version of it.

With regard to calculation of the transmission component, I agree that the 
T&D rate for core, if allocated on a system average basis is understated.  
Reviewing some data filed by PG&E in the rate design hearing, I suggest that 
the T&D component be factored up by 1.25.  This is based on the average T&D 
component for PG&E's "core" customers to the average system T&D rate 
component.  Similar information was not available for SCE and San Diego, but 
suggest it could be used as a proxy.

Robert

I am on back to back conference calls.  What would you like me to do to help 
get materials prepared for Ken Lay?  I'm available at about 11:45 AM my time 
if you'd like to try to talk then.  Just let me know.

Best,

What are the details for tomorrow?

Looks complete to me.  No comments.

Rick, Jim and Jeff:  Here's a draft of the e-mail I intend to send to Sandy 
and Mike re: use of Mike Day in Sacramento.  Let me know your thoughts.  

It appears from talking with both of you that we have some confusion on how 
we will contract for legal services to support or legislative efforts.  
Hopefully this e-mail will clarify the process so there is no confusion in 
the future and so that Mike can feel comfortable he is completing work that 
is authorized and for which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears that Goodin, MacBride has billings as of May 11 for 
approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall profits, the "Global 
Settlement," Power Plant Siting.  We will cover these amounts because of the 
apparent confusion with our budgeting and approval process.  The amounts 
already incurred should be included in the RCRs discussed below.  

2.  As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May 
was conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know 
we terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs 
were filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis; the 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, a proposed budget is not RCR approval.  

3.  In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arises--i.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, then I should be 
contacted before completing any work.  If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes 
should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, then Rick Shapiro should be 
contacted.   In this regard, I authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in 
the Direct Access coalition meetings taking place today and tomorrow.  I also 
authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  To the maximum extent possible, I expect that Mike will 
include Leslie Lawner in future Direct Access meetings, legislative drafting 
efforts, etc.  

4.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, I should be contacted before undertaking an assignment.  
If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, 
then Rick Shapiro should be contacted.  I can be reached through my office 
line--503.464.7945, pager--888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  I wear 
the pager at all times and respond immediately to messages left on the 
pager.  

5.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride; it simply means that before that work begins 
Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and "Plan B," to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  I 
recognize that Sacramento is a difficult environment and that there is 
substantial pressure on both of you.  However, we are under an obligation to 
use our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process is designed to meet that responsiblity.  

sorry to bother you with this, but could you please fax me the governor's 
response to plan B?  thx, jeff

Monday--In office
Tuesday--Portland--Meet with ENA
Wednesday--Portland
Thursday--In office
Friday--Vacation day possibly

My apologies in the delay getting this to you.

Apparently it didn't go very well.  Burton said he didn't have to deal with 
Reps. cause he
controls a 2/3 vote in his house.  Brulte called Rep leadership together in 
his office last
night to discuss their next move.  This is just the beginning of the dance, 
however.  I'll
let you know.

Also, Zaremberg said he got a call from a reporter who told him the PUC 
decision today would
be friendlier to business.  You probably know that and more, but I'm passing 
it on.
Zaremberg is also going to work on Burton and his blind faith in consumer 
strategies.

2 more celebratory items I forgot - well actually, I forgot one and did not
know about the other...

#1 - Jeff Dasovitch, Scott Laughlin, Cameron Sellers, Nancy Sellers, and
Prentice Sellers - are all SMOKE FREE!!     Now that is something to
celebrate!!

and - - -#2 - drum roll  drum roll  drum roll  DRUM ROLL   DRUM ROLL   

On Saturday, May 12, Mr. Scott Warner Laughlin asked Ms. Cameron Smith
Sellers to marry him.  And she
said............................................YES!!!!!   Isn't that just
the most wonderful news!!!!!!!  We are all so happy and excited!

OK - now for a wine tasting update.  Every "unit" should bring 2 bottles of
each wine (1 won't make it with this large a crowd).  It does not have to be
from your designated local area ( LizAnne was making noises about the
Sonoma/Napa/Santa Cruz disparity) - it can just be something you think is
yummy.

Saturday night let's make it Pinot Noir and Sunday Chardonnay, since no one
had any burning favorites!

Chris and Cristina have a family reunion that they have to attend  - but
they promise that the THREE of them will be with us next year!  We will
really miss you guys!

Anything else?

Thanks for the commnets, Lynn.

I've faxed you a copy of "Plan B."

I'll let others chime in, but ideally it seemsthat we'd want to start the 
meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed, 
comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion.  But at a minimum 
we'd want to get "the process" nailed down by very early next week.

          financial stability within 3-6 months; my guess is that it will
          be at least a year
          if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we need to make
          sure that they have the appropriate risk management tools
          (ability to enter forward contracts, options, etc.)
          if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we also need to
          have assurances that the situation we have today won't happen
          again;  for example, if the state assigns the CDWR contracts to
          the IOUs and three years from now the market price is less than
          the contract price, what assurances does anyone have that the PUC
          will not try to make the IOUs absorb the difference
          If we want to go to a core/non-core approach, why do we need to
          wait 18-24 months;  it seems to me that we could start that
          process now
          As for legal claims and investigations, we need to make clear
          that we want to resolve all state and federal claims;  the civil
          claims present a different set of challenges for resolution
          as for discounts on receivables, I'm not ready to commit one way
          or another; however, if there are discounts they must apply to
          all market participants - not just the ones that Davis can get to
          the table.

Greetings:
n order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were
on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed
anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
   Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael
   Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
   On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed
   that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
   A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would
   take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy
   makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops.
   Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible
   process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face,
   for however long it takes to work out a resolution.
   It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning
   of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
   It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to
   be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
   There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan
   B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an
   alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that
   call I received a copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me
   your fax number.
   Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in
   meeting on Friday.
   Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings
   agency level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of
   the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state
   seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:       The Credit Issue
   Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start
   tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.
   Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by
   the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the
   California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR
   gets paid for power services delivered.
   If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.

Item #2:       Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
   It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's
   meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a
   comprehensive solution.
   Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The
   following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive,
   but a starting point for discussion.
     Utility creditworthiness
        retail rates must reflect costs
     Increase supply
        streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
     Decrease demand
        establish real-time pricing
        implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
     Create a real market
        Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible
        (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to
        creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months)
        Return the procurement role to the utilities
        Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
        Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for
        electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural
        gas
     Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
        Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission,
        generation, etc.
     Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
        Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding
        that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

"Plan B"
As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that 
has been working on a "Plan B."
They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's 
MOU with Edison.
The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including 
Republicans, to get input into how "Plan B" can improve upon the MOU.
First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is 
rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to 
the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be 
bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is 
attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple 
of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis 
may be emerging.
Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a 
mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good 
ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to 
require a lot more work to get right.
Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement
In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in 
yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized 
several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable.
On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat 
apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it 
to the Legislature to take the lead role.
The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were 
not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that 
attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter.
Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of 
the discount that suppliers would be willing to take.
The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while 
excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable.
The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but 
made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the 
necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff 
implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the 
process of negotiations underway.
Next Steps
If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will 
brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to 
resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power 
deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet 
separately to discuss next steps.
Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies.  
Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of "Plan B."  Sandi mentioned 
that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those 
that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to 
the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred 
Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera 
is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor 
hired to advise him on the crisis.  
If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll 
get it to you.

Jeff

Hi Maureen:

Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg 
and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.  The letter 
1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work 
together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key 
components of a comprehensive solution.  Could you please get a copy of the 
letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken 
Lay?    Thanks very much for your help.

Best,
Jeff

I'll buckle up.  

P.S. 1Scott faxed you a letter from Cox and Brulte to Hertzberg and Burton.  
Check  it out.  It's a pretty darned smart letter:  1) very cooperative 2) 
substantively attractive and rational.

Best,

Sorry I had to get off the call early.  Hope it helped.  If there's anything 
else you need, just let me know.

FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems 
that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go 
figure.

Ok, cut the shakespeare.  What's your vote?  She wrote again in inquiring.

Thank you for the feedback.  We're "sanitizing" the document a wee bit 
(taking out the "opposing view--response" part).  When that's done, I assume 
it will OK to distribute.  Karen?

Jeff--I just today had a chance to review this document.  If you're still 
looking for comments I have one suggestion.

Under section 1 you list the problem and then the solution and then use the 
heading "Don't make matters worse".  If you could somehow highlight that 
section--make it stand out more.  The folks that you are trying to 
reach--business leaders---understand capital markets and how all of the 
rhetoric and investigations and allegations can discourage investment.  

I would like to be able to send this document when you get it finished to 
some of our contacts in the gov's offices--ok with you?  

Lastly, I love the chart on growth.

Greetings:
As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East.  
As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background 
and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during 
his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.  McNealy and others 
have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try 
to advance the ball.

I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all 
errors, omissions, ramblings, etc.  Wanted to distribute, however, to make 
sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.  Know folks are busy, 
but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any 
comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.

FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems 
that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go

Few changes made.  Here it is.

The place (outside) is a mess and needs some clean-up (e.g., get all that old 
wood out of the front yard, whack down the weeds).  Possible for you guys to 
come up next Wednesday night and we can do a quick clean up on Thursday.  I'm 
going to try to hire a hauling company to help us and haul it away.  If 
Cameron has to work are you available?

Best,

I'll do it, babe.

Apologies.  Can we make it 4?

Cameron will definately have to work, but I could certainly come up and 
help. If she'll let me, that is.... I agree that tidying up is in order. 
It's starting to look overgrown and unused, so I'll do anything I can to 
help. Let me break the news to Cameron and I'll get back to you...

thanks.  talk to you then.

Hi Christine:

Yes, forwarded the email you sent last week.  Here's where folks came out.  
First, we think that the folks in your first group are mean.  Second, it's a 
real challenge managing a group of four and there's concern that five will 
break the camel's back.  Suggestion came up that it might be much more 
mangageable if you could try to link up with a smaller group first.  If 
there's a problem finding a smaller group, then we could try to do five and 
hope the ship don't sink?

Sound reasonable?

Jeff

Jeff,

Have you had a chance to convey what I said to the group, and can I join?
Professor Aceves was aware that I talked to you about joining your group, and
he sent me an email asking to confirm that I was now in a group. I'd certainly
like to be! As you know, I want to make sure I am in one to do the next
assignment with. Please let me know, so that if I am joining your group I can
make the meetings and contribute to the next case. I do really appreciate your
help. :)

Thanks,
Christine

u see letter from barry goode to u re: lawsuits NOT on table?  jeff

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
"Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Jeff

Just in case anyone had any doubts about how Davis is approaching the 
issue......

Davis announces four new energy advisors

Updated: May 18, 2001 - 2:54 p.m. 
Gov. Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including 
members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team. 

Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy 
campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the 
governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new 
director of communications. 

Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months. 

Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a 
year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal 
regulators and with generators. 

Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the 
Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid. 

Fluckiger is "on loan" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers, 
Maviglio said.

(i was far from coherent last night...)  Have you gotten any feedback from 
Steve?  Ken had wanted us to send this out today.  If not, we need to send it 
out Monday unless Steve has objections.  Any word?

Did Ken say anything about the meeting yesterday on your way to the airport?  
Yesterday was much too long a day.  I'm going to crash early tonight and will 
probably sleep thru the weekend.

talk soon.

Nice job.  Only comment is that the crazies in California now find market 
power under every rock and in every pipeline.  I think there's a chance that 
someone might assert that 20% share equals market power.  Might want to say 
"significant supplier" or something similar.  No big deal, but I thought I'd 
flag it for your consideration.

she had a really, really good time and felt really neat about the whole 
thing.  She's wonderful and you guys gave her the wonderful day that she 
earned and deserved.  Thanks so much.

And, as usual, thanks for being great hosts yesterday (Nancy, you outdid 
yourself with dinner).

OK, so I am doing everything that I can to leave for the Dome Wednesday 
night.  If you guys want, we can pack up the Suburban with everything that 
needs to go up ( or at least just about everything), and we can drive it up 
and then you two can take my SAAB up.  Then, coming back, you can drive the 
Suburban and I can drive the SAAB.  What do you think?

Finally, Eldon, do you have the Blue Book at your house?  I'm looking for the 
number of someone I can get to haul away all the crap (junk from around the 
generator shed, that rotten ol' pile of wood by the driveway, the 
un-salvagable wood from the old deck, etc.).  Can you find a couple "hauler" 
numbers in there and send me the numbers?  Thanks a million.

you were the one who made her day by being so sweet to her!  It was a fun
day though.  Wednesday night sounds great - we will do our best to get stuff
ready to go.  You would have to turn on the frig immediately though -
because you'll have to take up the cooler with the turkeys in it.  They will
be frozen and just need to be in a frig until Saturday.   Remind Prentice to
get the cooler!  As far as the booze goes, we can send all that so the only
big thing would be the rest of the food and your trunk is pretty good size -
right??

Following is the editorial that resulted from IEP's editorial board meeting 
with the Orange County register on 
May 24:

Is price gouging root of crisis? 
Orange County Register Editorial
May 21, 2001

The president is "allowing the price-gouging energy companies, many of whom 
reside in Texas, to get away with murder," Gov. Gray Davis said on Thursday 
in response to a George W. Bush energy plan that doesn't call for caps on the 
price of electricity sold by out-of-state generators to California. 

This remark captured the essence of the Davis approach to the energy 
problems: Blame everybody else, call for government price controls even 
though they historically have reduced the supply of energy, and use divisive 
and even conspiratorial rhetoric.

On the same day Governor Davis was blasting the Bush energy plan, his 
appointee who runs the Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch, told a 
newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack 
up prices. Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that he found evidence of what 
Ms. Lynch called "artificial shortages."

We're interested in seeing the evidence, of course. But it looks suspiciously 
like politicians are using the "power-gouging" theory as a way to bluster 
rather than come up with concrete solutions. It also is a way for those who 
are ideologically hostile to deregulation - perhaps cynical of business and 
capitalism in general - to demonize merchant generators and pave the way for 
a government takeover.

No doubt, wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed. Prices zoomed from 
$200 a megawatt hour late last year to nearly $2,000 last week, according to 
the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a 
cause of the price spike.

Yet a number of analysts have found the price-gouging theory to be dubious. A 
Dow Jones Newswire column analyzed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data 
on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers. Yes, there were 
nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big 
producers in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. But, as writer Mark Golden 
pointed out, outages for all plants - including municipally owned ones and 
small Qualifying Facilities that have no incentive to game the system - were 
658 percent higher in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. The writer notes that 
"four of the Big 5 are either constructing big new generators in California 
or have applied for permits to do so. That would seem to fly in the face of a 
withholding strategy."

An April paper co-authored by William Hogan, a professor at the John F. 
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, could not prove there 
wasn't manipulation, but explained, "it is unlikely to be the dominant factor 
and may not even be significant."

The bigger issue, the Hogan paper argued, is the "seriously flawed" 
restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse. "[T]he 
principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the 
other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the 
underlying causes of the market meltdown."

Other analysts argue that, to whatever degree price-gouging has taken place, 
it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules 
that have distorted the market.

The large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy, the 
power generators say, but the result of needed maintenance on facilities that 
have been overworked. Many of these are older plants that require more 
shutdowns for maintenance than new ones.

"People can invest money in various different markets," Jan Smutny-Jones told 
us; he is executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association 
in Sacramento, which represents QFs and merchant generators. With politically 
charged hearings, demonization of power generators, proposals for 
excess-profits taxes and threats of seizing property made by California 
Democrats, he said generators may conclude that California is a dangerous 
place to invest.

Gov. Davis said the Bush plan won't add any new electrical power. But neither 
will Davis' grandstanding about price-gougers. 

In fact, it may even dissuade electricity investment. The governor needs to 
apply his "will it create new power?" standard to his own rhetoric, then get 
busy leading the state out of this mess.

Power shortage shifts attitudes 
Posted at 10:51 p.m. PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001 
BY NOAM LEVEY 
Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 
California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy 
and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically 
shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new 
poll shows. 
Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the 
wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly 
two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to 
the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. 
And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose 
approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in 
January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll. 
``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in 
the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey. ``But what is most 
surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred. . . . It is very 
dramatic.'' 
Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting 
Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide. 
Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important 
issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and 
6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues. In 
recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top 
issue. 
And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply, 
demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great 
deal.'' 
``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and 
without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a 
46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose. 
Results dismissed 
The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as 
predictable. ``The voters are in a very bad mood. They are not happy with 
anyone in this drama,'' South said. ``But these poll numbers need to be taken 
in context. . . . People don't understand what he's done because it is very 
hard to communicate that in this state.'' 
South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of 
Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year. Davis is expected 
to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him. Davis 
also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004. 
The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current 
electricity crisis. Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are 
culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who 
blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's 
landmark deregulation five years ago. 
``He didn't make the deregulation disaster. I think that's Pete Wilson's 
legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose. 
Criticism for Davis 
But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading 
California out of its power troubles. 
Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling 
the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the 
governor for not doing more. 
Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis 
involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to 
control the price that California is being forced to pay for power. 
The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected. But for 
the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of 
words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support 
price caps on electricity. 
Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and 
focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power. 
The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of 
Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the 
crisis. 
But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18 
percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8 
percent favored federal price controls on generators. 
That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who 
have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of 
power to mine the California market for excessive profits. 
``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the 
price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the 
Independent Energy Producers Association. Electricity generators argue that 
price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants. 
Backing re-regulation 
Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the 
electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will 
come when Californians' power bills start rising next month. 
``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off 
the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``But in three weeks, California is going to 
face a catastrophe. This is going to hit supernova status. . . . Once people 
understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the 
only solution will be re-regulation.'' 
Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear, 
however. 
``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people 
view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the 
Public Policy Institute of California. ``There is less confidence in the 
state's ability to plan for the long-term future. And that is giving people 
worry. 
``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined 
public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''

No problem.  Let's talk.  I'm really comfortably having you and me and your 
mom and keith talk about.  I'm very interested in buying Jay's property, but 
I don't even the details yet.  Here's my suggestion.  If they want to come up 
that bad, they should.  My agent is a very cool person up there.  Here name 
is Sharon Burningham.  She is with Coldwell Banker.  Her number is 
707.884.5270.  ext. 308.  You should feel free to tell your mom that Prentice 
and I have always have the intention of buying Jay's place, and we've had a 
sort of unspoken agreement that he'd give us the first "head's up" when he 
decided to sell.  To be honest, we didn't expect it to be this quick, but 
hey, it is what it is.  You can also tell your mom that I'm very happy to 
talk about partnering with her.  But it's WAY to early right now.  As we 
discussed, I need to spend some time with Jay---the other very important 
thing for me is that Jay's a very good friend, and I want to protect that, 
too.  In the meantime, I think that it would be great for your mom and Keith 
to have Sharon take them around and show them some killer 
million--plus--dollar homes and have some fun cruising around and seeing what 
the area has to offer.  I'm real happy to call Sharon, too.  That sound like 
a plan?  Where can I call you?

Best,
Jeff

Dude,

I just talked to my mom, and they are chomping at the bit, if that's the 
right expression. My mom even wants to come up Wed and stay til Thurs night! 
I told her to chill a bit, that she might not be able to see Jay's property. 
She still wants to come up, so I told her we might be able to look at some 
other stuff, so do you think I should talk to an agent about this? They are 
damn excited, and I don't really know how to calm them down. They went to 
bookstores and looked at pictures of the area. They are probably talking 
about it all the time. I tell you this so you know what I'm dealing with 
over here. She also asked me if you were thinking of buying it, and I told 
her I wasn't sure. Do you want me to tell her that you're thinking about it? 
I know they'd totally respect your position, if we told them that. I'm not 
sure I even want them to come up this week, but they are so emphatic that 
it'd be nothing less than an insult to tell them not to. Anyway, give me 
some advise on this matter, please.

Cheers!

Scott

Also, thanks for giving Cameron your car; I know she's psyched.

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
"Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  Apologies for the oversight of not including you on the list.  If you

The following notes are from Ken Smith from State Controller Kathleen
Connell's press conference today:

California State Controller Kathleen Connell held a press conference
today.  Although the Dow Newswire said it would be to disclose long-term
contracts, the event focused on what she believes will be an additional
need for borrowing beyond the energy bonds.

She anticipates an additional $4 billion in borrowing will be needed in
February to meet expected costs.  The borrowing should, she said, be
done as Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANs), short-term notes at a lower
interest rates (about 4%) that must be paid back by the end of the year,
rather than as additional energy bonds.  She categorized the current
budget situation as =01&the same kind of environment as a bad budget year,=
=018
and said California should maintain at least a 3% reserve.

She did not comment on individual contracts except to say there are 17
different contracts.

Charts her office had prepared showed that $5.136 billion had been spent
on energy purchases through 5/17/01; about 99% of that went to spot
market purchases.  There was also a chart that showed projected
expenditures under the Governor=01,s plan to be $8.349 billion for the
period January 1-June 1, 2001, with about 89% of that going to spot
market purchases.  How these numbers work together was confusing =01) I
checked with a reporter, who said he was also unclear.  I=01,ll try to get
this cleared up this afternoon.

An easel held a large photocopy of a $533 million check to Mirant, which
is the largest energy check written to date.   More has been paid to
Reliant =01) she put it at about 25% of total expenditures =01) but =01&we =
have
never written a check to Reliant over $500 million=018 because of the way
they invoice.

She said the Governor=01,s financial assumptions for power =01&do not fit i=
nto
the most likely scenario=018 and that summer conditions will greatly affect
the actual spending needs.  She noted that DWR estimates it will spend
$9.2 billion through June 30, 2002, although the PUC has only authorized
$7.5 billion.

The other significant announcement was that she plans to use her
authority with the Board of Equalization to hold hearings to determine
whether power plants sold by utilities have been properly assessed for
property taxes.  Apparently, they are still on the tax rolls at previous
rates, but she believes the profits recorded by some generators means
the plants may be more valuable than their current assessments.

A press release was not distributed at the event, although there may be
one issued later today.

Calif Probe Focuses On Dynegy,Mirant Plants-Commissioners    =20
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 05:28 PM=01;ET     =01;=20
=01;
By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California officials are focusing an investigation=
=20
into the state's wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated=
=20
by two of the state's largest merchant power companies, Mirant Corp. (MIR,=
=20
news, msgs) and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs) and N=
RG=20
Energy (NRG, news, msgs), according to two commissioners on the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission.=20

The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output wa=
s=20
withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at=20
Mirant's Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant,=
=20
which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG, near San Diego.=20

All power plants in the state are being examined, but investigators have=20
found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply=
=20
shortages, causing market prices to rise.=20

But so far, the commissioners said, investigators have found no activity th=
at=20
is clearly illegal.=20

"Is it unethical? Yes," one PUC commissioner said. "But is it illegal? No,=
=20
unless there was collusion. This is the system we set up. What the generato=
rs=20
are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize=
=20
your profit to shareholders."=20

Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges.=20

"What we did was both legal and ethical," said Mirant spokesman Chuck=20
Griffin. "There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and=
=20
running. Unequivocally, we have never held anything back."=20

Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units, which are=20
supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand, Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel=
l=20
said. The plant is operated by NRG, but Dynegy markets the power from the=
=20
plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold.=
=20

"We've done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices," Stengell said.=20
"Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day. Our=20
production increases and decreases to follow changing demand. Ultimately, t=
he=20
ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch."=20

A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the=
=20
ongoing investigation.=20

CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her=
=20
office and that of Lockyer's have enough information to take legal action=
=20
against generators next month, though she declined to name the companies=20
involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still=20
under review.=20

"We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up,"=
=20
Griffin said. "This whole idea that any generation was held back at any tim=
e=20
is completely bogus. It is pure political rhetoric."=20

Mirant's California power plants have run at full power during critical tim=
es=20
except under one of two conditions, Griffin said. Either generating units=
=20
were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed, or they were beginnin=
g=20
to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to=
=20
get permission to run at full power any longer.=20

"There are no other reasons than those two," said Griffin.=20

Nevertheless, several employees at the power plants involved have testified=
=20
that generating units were ramped down even when the state's Independent=20
System Operator had warned of tight supplies, according to one commissioner=
.=20

And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow=20
Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegy's Houston trading floor to "ramp=
=20
down" the large 951-megawatt plant on at least 10 occasions when he knew=20
power supplies were tight.=20

"We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed=
=20
the megawatts," the employee said. "Then the spot price would go up, but we=
=20
didn't really pay too much attention to that, because as far as we know=20
everybody was doing this. We knew how much power other plants were operatin=
g=20
at, and we knew they weren't at full capacity."=20

NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dyne=
gy=20
and Dynegy tells NRG what to do. "And there have been conditions when the I=
SO=20
told us to ramp down during Stage 2 emergencies," Moore said.=20

Also, one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the state's deregulation law=
=20
doesn't require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into th=
e=20
market.=20

The state's incumbent utilities, who were forced to sell their power plants=
=20
as part of deregulation, also may have contributed to the problem, accordin=
g=20
to an ISO study. By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet the=
ir=20
customers projected needs, the state's three main utilities contributed to =
36=20
Stage 1 and 2 power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to=
=20
pay a much higher price to keep the lights on.=20

The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldn't=
=20
have to pay the generators' high bid prices. The ISO market last year had a=
=20
price cap, while other markets did not.=20

Mirant's Griffin, meanwhile, said all the finger pointing isn't solving the=
=20
state's problem.=20

"If they are going to get to a solution in California, they have to get=20
beyond silly political rhetoric," Griffin said. "The real solution to the=
=20
problem is to get new supply, and if they are going to do that they have to=

Though I had a somewhat different notion when I initially raised the idea of 
co-sponsorship, I agree with Lee's observations and think that we should 
proceed the way he suggests.

gramlr@pjm.com on 08/29/2000 04:06:56 PM
All,
Lee asked me to forward this.  I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from
anyone on speakers.

I guess Lee's e-mail changes things.  If the business school wants to go 
forward
with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one.  
Jeff
has said he likes the idea of coordinating.  Bill and Allen, what do you 
think?
I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief
economist at DOJ.  As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford
economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than
anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,
Australia, and California.  He speaks a mile a minute though and his
understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive.

I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute.  I heard from Michael
Berg this morning.  So he will not be participating in our discussions either.

My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school.  One positive outcome 
of
this would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch
economic policy faculty.  Overshadowing is possible.  Lee, does Dean Nacht 
have
a view on joint sponsorship?

OK gang, she's hell bent, and I've spent about as much time as I'm willing on 
this.  Sorry about the hassle---Jimmie, if you hadn't used that colorful 
language, we wouldn't be in this mess.  Anyway, unless I hear strong protests 
in the next 30 minutes, I'm writing back to say she can join (and has to do

Jeff,

I appreciate your help. I sent a note to the Prof last week letting him know 
your
concerns and asking him to verify once more that a group size of 5 was OK. I 
got
his response today that it was. Apparently, my old group was the only one 
with 3,
most of the others have at least 4. If there really is a lot of resistance I 
will
ask the Professor to assign me randomly to a group. I would simply prefer to 
join
one that I chose. I appreciate you're group's helping me out of this awkward 
spot,
if they decide to let me in. Let me know,

Thanks,
Christine

Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us 
to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are 
not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file 
confidential.  

Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers 
if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to 
noncore customers.  
Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases 
when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to 
businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is 
below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.)
Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates 
significantly above the Lynch rates.  
Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that 
it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by 
the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates 
again soon. 
In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which 
will require yet additional increases.
I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or 
tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put 
100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive 
market and out from under Loretta).
I will report back after we've spoken.
All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome 
and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

So far there's Wild Goose, but there in Northern California--have to go 
through the Wheeler bottleneck--so that likely won't hunt.  Lodi's a 
possibility, but it's well inland, unlike the significantly more strategic 
storage assets on the coast.  In addition, Lodi's in the process of selling, 
so there's some uncertainty in the short run.  Bottom line, folks are trying 
to build competitive storage, but it's in the "emerging" phase in a very 
hostile environment.  We should discuss further, though; very interesting 
idea.

Robert & Jeff --

Is there some other (competitive) storage that would want to work with our 
deal in CA other than SocalGas?  Maybe find someone adding some new storage.

Jim

Robert Neustaedter@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
05/16/2001 10:20 AM
In response to your request to review the SoCalGas tariff with respect to 
storage service for quantities of  gasified LNG in excess of market I present 
the following.

SoCalGas has various storage rate schedules available to its customers, 
including forms of interruptible storage service.

Because of the long-term nature of the proposed project and firm injection 
requirements I focused on Schedule No. G-LTS (firm Long-Term Storage Service).

Pricing under this schedule is very flexible (both upwards and downwards).  I 
have used the rates included in the tariff which are suppossed to closely 
correspond to utilty cost of providing such service and are also consistent 
with rates previously supplied for economic modeling purposes.  Keep in mind, 
these are benchmark costs, and may be subject to downward or upward 
negotiation.

Because of the magnitude of the injection quantities, it was advised that 
some expansion of storage capabilities may be required.

Fixed charges consist of an annual inventory capacity charge, and annual 
withdrawal capacity charge and a monthly firm injection charge.  The monthly 
firm injection charge is the largest cost component.  Based on conversations 
with SoCalGas, firm injection rights (similar to pipeline capacity) would be 
sold on a monthly basis.  Consequently, in order to have firm rights to 
injection capacity, it would have to be reserved 365 days out of a year.  
During the off-peak season, "as-available" injection rights may be used that 
could substantially lower the cost, but given the inflexibility of unloading 
of the LNG ships, this was not considered.

Variable costs would consist of injection and withdrawal charges in the 
applicable periods (peak and off-peak) for injection and withdrawal 
quantities.

A fuel retention factor of 2.44% would be applied to injections during the 
peak period.

While not necessarily affecting the overall costs, a transmission charge on 
injections and withdrawals would also be assessed.  A transmission charge on 
injections would appear as a debit on the invoice, and an equal transmission 
charge on withdrawals would appear as a credit, effectively resulting in a 
wash.  However, for cash flow purposes it should be considered.  The 
transmission charge is approximately 57 cents per dekatherm.

Transportation from storage would require a separate contract.

A spreadsheet is attached that quantifies the storage cost on an annual basis 
utilizing the injection/ withdrawal and inventory assumptions provided.  
Again, please keep in mind that the actual costs are negotiable.

I hope this helps in your analysis, and please feel free to call and discuss 
further.

Robert

but the D.C. based arm of the Democratic National Committee has started an ad 
campaign against Republicans (in San Diego I believe).  The head of the 
committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of, "the 
Republicans in Washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and "we" 
want to make sure that they're held accountable."

plz call as soon as you have a second.  thx, jeff

I spoke again briefly with Hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion 
late last night with the guy from CSFB who's been providing Hertzberg with 
pro bono financial advice on the crisis.  Hertzberg is still hot on putting 
all of the utility past due on the noncore, though his consultant and I 
agreed that, politically, the number is more likely to end up somewhere south 
of 100% (if this thing gets legs).  Hertzberg asked for, and we provided 
today, a "fifth scenario," which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of 
core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.  It's attached.  Will 
report back with any further developments.

Note: Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with 
this one.  That file accidentally had the same cents/kwh, noncore rate for 
both Edison and PG&E.  Edison's rate should be 12.98 cents/kwh NOT 12.21 
cents/kwh. It's the line that reads "Total cost to Noncore under CPUC's 
Recent Decision."

Greetings Hap:
Hope all's well and Edison's paying you.  

Please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up 
on filings like these in California prior to filing.

As you know, it's crazy in California, with a lot flying around in numerous 
forums.  Even Ken Lay's frequently been to California over the past couple of 
months trying to educate and advocate rational, detailed solutions.  Want to 
make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to 
get this ridiculous state back on track.

Not trying to slow you down, or dictate content; rather, given the 
high-stakes nature of the California situation, coordination is critical.  
Thanks much.

Best,
Jeff

Yes, there are numerous default service auction models in operation or
proposed, both in electricity and other utilities. The government of New
South Wales in Australia is implementing a model similar to this. In
Georgia, I think they recently had an auction to serve customers served by a
gas retailer that went bust. Similar mechanisms have been used for years in
the telecoms business for serving specific client bases, such as rural
customers. Examples have been in Chile, and even in the U.S. (auctions for
"universal service obligations").

We proposed a model for "third-party" default service standard supply for
Ontario (working for Aleck Dadson of Enron Canada). This allowed the
standard supply provider to meet its obligation by competitive means,
including holding an auction. The idea was to provide customers hedging in a
framework that allowed for competition in default service.

Allan Zaremberg, President of the California Chamber of Commerce, met
with John Burton to discuss energy.  One of the items which John Burton
brought up to Allan was Bob Hertzberg's core/non-core proposal.
According to the Chamber, Burton is interested in the concept and wants
to get Allan's thoughts.  The Chamber is very interested in hearing more
about the proposal which they attribute to Enron and would like
documentation.  Could someone please forward the appropriate documents
to me.  I also suggested that the Chamber and Enron circle back to
discuss the item in greater detail as soon as possible.

Was it an emergency bill?

	Please respond to "Ken Smith"
		 
The following are summaries of today's appearance by Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
 
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at a lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would "love it to death," meaning it would 
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
 
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC.  He 
said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate.
 
Burton is obviously troubled by the MOU; he said "some people" say it doesn't 
just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.  He said the following 
would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable:
 
Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% "haircut";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what 
the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay back debt.
 
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said "no" and that he feels 
the parent should pay "a ton."  That led to a discussion of the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like. He used the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.  A larger infusion of cash 
from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate 
component. 
 
Burton called the dedicated rate component a "big problem" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign.
 
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more (note:  
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk 
shows and other media).  He later threw out the number $200.  The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.  It's tough medicine, but as he put it, 
"You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy, but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK."
 
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how he believe the 
situation should be handled:  "The only way to deal with exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards."
 
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU, Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December.
 
 
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
 
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit 
against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit.  A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.  If 
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
 
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City of 
Oakland.  At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty. Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz 
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.  
 
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling within 21 days.
 
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
 
Joe Cotchett said the suit is "very basic" and is based on the Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to "fair and justifiable" rates.  A 
primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a "health and welfare" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts.  
He said it is "not an economic lawsuit -- it's about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities."  Today also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
 
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were opportunities to 
exert market power.  He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility (obviously 
AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant off-line and 
substituting higher rates.  He said, however, that this order had been sealed.
 
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of blackouts this summer, 
which could mean four hours a day.  That could be, he said, "potentially the 
ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration."  Cotchett noted that only 
hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from blackouts, which does not 
protect surgical centers or many health facilities.
 
Jerry Brown added that "prices are unjust and people are suffering."  
Continued high prices could mean "potential civic disruption," and that there 
will be "more actions to mobilize" Western mayors.
 
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit.
 
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV here as a legal 
expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his Press 
Club appearance.  He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on 
to say that the state had no standing to file the suit. Burton's lawyer's 
sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team.
 
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three 
years, and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably.  It has 
failed to define "fair and justifiable"; that failure, he said, violates the 
Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution.
 
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon "fellow Republicans" 
to support the effort.
 
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she believed that if 
the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
 
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because 
"5 generators supply 90%" of the electricity in CA and all five have rate 
renewals before FERC.  He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush 
v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards 
(regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal Protection 
clause.  He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have 
requested briefs:  Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Minnesota and one 
other he didn't name.  None of these states has yet committed to joining the 
suit.

To get from the California border down to Mexico, you would get service off 
of SoCalGas' and SDG&E's tariff (i.e., you have to wheel through SoCalGas and 
SDG&E to get there.  There may be a single tariff for that service, however 
(rather than taking service off of two tariffs).  I'll try to get the tariff 
numbers and get back to you.  All the tariffs are on Sempra's website.

	Kristin Walsh/ENRON@enronXgate
	05/23/2001 02:57 PM
		 
Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
? Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is 
that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and 
too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
? The Republicans will "suggest" that generators take a 30% haircut.  "We 
think this is doable."
? The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
? Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would 
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by 
the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
? Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to 
work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel 
"frozen out."  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an 
option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
? The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's 
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly 
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still 
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is 
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this 
may be unnecessary.
? The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a 
dedicated rate  component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of 
their  claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated 
through a  dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to 
strike a deal  for PG&E.
? Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in 
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell 
of pieces of  the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a 
lifetime stipulation on  how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as 
$5 billion if  it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the 
bankrutpcy judge to quell  the protests against such a plan that would very 
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly  believe that the Judge Montali would 
support this idea.

Bill Bradford and I have a phone call with PG&E at noon tomorrow.   We will 
advise everyone of what we learn.

Michael

Michael, how can we get with PG&E to determine where the discrepancy lies?

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,

Michael

I don't recall Lay saying that the increase should apply to DA customers.  We 
should discuss further just to make sure that we're all on the same page.

Best,
Jeff

Harry, Marty Sunde, Jeff Dasovich and I were on a trip with Ken Lay last 
week.  I understood from Marty that Ken may believe that all customers, 
including direct access, should pay the increase you mention.  Marty?  This 
was encouraging from a litigation exposure standpoint because, to the extent 
all consumers are treated alike, our DA customers who were resourced to 
utility service cannot claim to have been disadvantaged by our action.  The 
converse is also true:  if they have to pay because they were put back on 
utility service they may try to pass that cost through to us.  To the extent 
that any increase is to pay back DWR for buying power 2/1/01-3/31/02, and 
those on DA are not required to pay this, EES could have a substantial 
exposure to its customers.   Maybe we need to modify our strategy to take 
this into account.
SDGE's Advice Letter filing confirms that the ABX143 rate freeze of 6.5 cents 
does not apply to direct access.

In hearings on SDGE's potential rate increase for large customers:
SDGE has proposed to allocate all retained generation to small customers 
(below 100 kw).  Large customers would be served  by DWR (or be direct 
access).  It's apparent several parties have major problems with this.
It is interesting that SDGE has calculated the expected rate increase under 
their plan as 2.86 cents.  If large customers are allocated a piece of 
retained generation, the increase goes up to 2.99 cents.  In the latter case, 
large customers retain a CTC (related to QF contracts and other long term 
stranded costs) that they would lose in the former case.
Our involvement is to get an order 1) excluding DA from any rate increase 
(the proposed 2.86 cents) 2) excluding DA from any surcharge related to 
undercollection from the rate freeze (an amount that is not known at this 
point) 3) prorating the surcharge related to undercollection if the customer 
switches from DA to bundled service during the rate freeze period 4) ensuring 
there is a return to market pricing once the rate freeze is over.

PUC decisions on these issues are expected June 28.  There is no discussion 
of restricting movement between bundled service and DA.  On our issues noted 
above,  #1, 2, 4 have high probability of success; # 3 is 50/50.   

are you serious?

Given that we are already well into the Summer of '01, it now appears that 
further CDWR contracting will only lock CA into high prices.  The original 
idea was that CDWR could buy power at $80/mwh and ensure that retail rates 
wouldn't go higher.  Neither of these concepts have held true.

I think that Enron needs to consider actively oppossing any further 
contracting and a bond issuance in light of the potential harm that CDWR will 
do.  First, the prices they are getting won't be great for customers.  
Second, with the "new" stranded costs that will be created, direct access in 
the future won't have a chance.

Appreciate everyone's thoughts?

Jim

Greetings. Forgive the delays.  The meeting can largely be summarized by the 
CEC presentation.  I'll have Joseph email it to you.  In a nut shell, there's 
more interstate pipeline coming to the California border than there is 
INTRAstate capacity to take it from the California border to the 
consumer/business.  The CEC's forecasts show that things will be tight in 
California.  The thrust of the workshop is that, just like power plants, 
intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in California and California 
needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas 
infrastructure and do it quickly.   Hope this is helpful, and again, sorry 
for the delay.

Best,
Jeff

I am putting together a panel at the AB 1890 Retreat on natural gas issues
and would like to include an Enron representative. We are trying to get
folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the
ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on
the panel:

Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.
Natural Gas Issues
Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a
dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more
generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price
increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased
so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased
exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to
procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten
years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming
on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent,
unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the
largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be
the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply?

Moderator: Keith McCrea

Suggested Panelists:
____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner)
____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative)
____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine
____________, Enron
____________, Gas Storage Representative
Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective)

Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from
Enron? Thanks for your help.

Delaney

P.S. You better be planning to attend this year -- at least the day
sessions! :-)

Greetings:
Have you seen this?  Any view on whether there's a group of economists who 
think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response to 
this letter?

P.S. Talked to Tyson re: trying to get economists back in the middle of this, 
but I wasn't altogether successful.

From Kirsten's second report, sounds like the core/noncore is getting longer 
legs and moving more quickly.  I'm concerned about Bev speaking on our 
behalf---only because her knowledge base is quite low---and plan on phoning 
her to ensure that she has the message down pat.  Thoughts?

Also, I've forewarded the econ letter to Teece to see if we can get the 
"manifesto" group to respond.

You need to worry less about Cameron, because I think that it's one of those 
very deeply rooted Mom/daughter things, and will take time to work out.  

And I sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that 
my older sister went through with my Mom around the same age (which I wasn't 
particularly happy about, but I think it's normal, sort of).  I'd be happy to 
talk about it if you want some time.  

I think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting 
her own gig with Scott and it's going to be like a second "breaking away" 
(the one that comes after teen-age-dom).  So it's less about you and much 
more about her (and Scott, to some degree, too).  

I hope I'm not confusing matters more.

Bush: No Price Caps on Electricity 

By Ron Fournier
AP White House Correspondent
Tuesday, May 29, 2001; 4:17 p.m. EDT
LOS ANGELES dd Asked to impose federal caps on soaring electricity bills, 
President Bush called for an end to finger pointing and blame for 
California's energy crisis Tuesday. California Gov. Gray Davis persisted, "We 
are entitled to relief." 

On a three-day mission to improve his West Coast political prospects, the 
president played down his private meeting with Davis in favor of an unusually 
busy public schedule highlighting his efforts to conserve electricity at 
federal installations, ease summer energy costs to the poor and boost the 
state's long-term resources. 

Davis, a Democrat with hopes of challenging Bush for the presidency in 2004, 
demanded that Washington force down electricity prices that have cost 
California nearly $8 billion since January. 

"We are entitled to relief," the governor said in a public discussion with 
victims of the energy crunch, staged in the same hotel where Bush was 
staying. "It doesn't matter if someone thinks we should have relief, the law 
says we should have relief." 

Polls show voters in the nation's most populous state don't think either 
politician is doing enough to ease their power woes. 

A spokesman for Davis dismissed Bush's call for a new tone on the energy 
debate. 

"We're asking the president to step up to the plate to use the power that 
only he has, and that's to provide some short-term price relief," spokesman 
Steve Maviglio said. 

Bush and Davis sparred in separate public events before their long-awaited 
meeting, scheduled for late Tuesday. 

The session was tightly choreographed, and neither side expected a resolution 
of their differences. Too much was at stake: After weeks of mixed signals, 
Bush needs to show Californians he sympathizes with their power problems. 
Davis, his approval rating plummeting, is searching for a scapegoat d and a 
way out of the energy crunch. 

Shortages and high prices could spread elsewhere and cause political problems 
for Bush. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham was in Yonkers, N.Y., on Tuesday, 
warning that transmission bottlenecks are not restricted to California. 

Bush has criticized California, and by implication Davis himself, for not 
building more power plants or moving quicker to respond to fallout from 
faulty state deregulation laws. He sought Tuesday to remain above the fray, 
even as White House advisers continued to criticize Davis privately and 
predict that the governor's confrontational approach would backfire. 

"Energy debates sometimes throw off some sparks, but this is no time for 
harsh rhetoric. It's certainly no time for name calling. It's time for 
leadership. It's time for results. It's time to put politics aside and focus 
on the best interests of the people," Bush said during a visit to Camp 
Pendleton, a Marine base that has cut its energy usage. 

He did not mention price caps, but advisers said Bush had not budged from his 
belief that artificial limits won't lower consumers' bill and will lead to 
supply problems down the road. 

In the sundappled courtyard of the 1st Marine Division headquarters d 
nicknamed "the White House" for the color of its low-slung wood facade d Bush 
delivered a speech offering small measures of federal help to California. 

The initiatives include: 

d$150 million to help low-income Americans pay energy bills this summer. He 
will ask Congress to approve the additional spending for this fiscal year, 
which ends in October. 

dHis announcement that military facilities in California have exceeded their 
goal of trimming usage by 10 percent during peak hours. 

dA Department of Energy project to stimulate the building of more electrical 
lines running north and south through the state. 

Bush also said his $1.35 trillion tax-cut plan will offer "some help" to 
people struggling to pay soaring energy bills. 

Davis, who was elected in 1998 in a landslide, has watched his job approval 
rating drop about 20 percentage points since January as he struggled to come 
to grips with the state's energy shortages and rolling blackouts. 

Bush's job approval rating is still relatively high, though 56 percent of 
Californians in a recent poll said they disapprove of his handling of the 
electricity crisis. 

The president has avoided the state since losing its 54 electoral votes to 
Democratic rival Al Gore by 12 percentage points. He visited 29 states to 
promote his tax and budget plans before finally coming to California. 

Senior Republicans, including some Bush advisers, privately concede that 
Bush's prospects are dim for winning California in 2004. They are working on 
electoral map models that don't include the state in his chase for 270 
electoral votes. 

Bush had to eek out a recount in Florida to win the presidency without 
California last year. 

Sooner on the horizon are the 2002 congressional elections, where California 
could tip the balance. Republicans say Bush has to improve his standing here 
to help the GOP maintain control of the House and regain the Senate.

Bush's visit to California draws protest over energy

Updated: May 29, 2001 - 11:43 a.m.

CAMP PENDLETON -- Political and consumer activists chanted anti-Bush slogans 
and derided the president's energy policy Tuesday, accusing the 
administration of tolerating price-gouging. 
About 100 protesters waved signs and shouted in support of rate caps at the 
gate of the Camp Pendleton Marine base, where Bush spoke to military 
personnel on his first stop of a two-day California visit. 
Protesters from the state Democratic Party, the Green Party and 
environmental, consumer and socialist organizations called on Bush to support 
capping energy prices that have soared in California.
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight 
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and 
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's 
electricity crisis. 
"We've got to stop the gouging and work towards a cleaner, more sane energy 
policy," said June Brashares of Global Exchange, an environmental and labor 
organization. 
Her father Bob Brashares, a 74-year-old retired minister from Escondido, 
criticized Bush for "complete inactivity" on the state's energy crisis. 
He said Bush apparently believes Californians should use their tax rebates to 
pay for rising energy costs. "It's a joke," he said. 
Several women wearing pig noses held signs saying: "Oilmen for Bush." 
In a speech to Marines on the base, Bush said: "It's certainly no time for 
name-calling. It's time for leadership. It's time to put politics aside and 
focus on the best interests of the people. This administration is focused on 
results. We are going to work together -- the federal government, the state 
government, the military and all the citizens." 
Bush has blamed California officials for the state's power woes and said 
price controls won't solve shortages. 
He was to speak with Gov. Gray Davis during a 20-minute session later 
Tuesday. 
Bush flew into the Marine base, 40 miles north of San Diego, without 
confronting the protesters. Military personnel and civilian workers largely 
ignored the group as they drove past the gate. 
At one point, the protesters attempted to walk onto the base. About a dozen 
California Highway Patrol officers in riot helmets moved to block their path. 
Several protesters expressed frustration that the president did not hear 
their complaints. 
"He should be here. He should address the crowd," said Patricia Verwiel, a 
fourth-grade teacher from Riverside. 
Cynthia Rich, a retired teacher from San Diego, agreed. "I think it's really 
cowardly for him to go on the base where he has a captive audience."
She called it "scandalous" that Bush planned to meet with Davis for only 20 
minutes. 
"That's a real insult to California," she said. 
Glen Brown, a 39-year-old neuroscientist, drove from San Francisco to protest 
Bush's appearance and rally support for development of wind and solar energy 
projects. 
"We're tired of corporate greed," said Brown, wearing a bushy purple clown 
wig and brightly colored jacket. "Essential services like energy shouldn't be 
at the whim of the free market."

Bush: No Price Caps on Electricity

By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer 

LOS ANGELES (AP) - President Bush traveled across the country to deliver news 
Gov. Gray Davis doesn't want to hear: He won't force down soaring electricity 
prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January.

The Republican president and the embattled Democratic governor arranged a 
20-meeting Tuesday to talk about California's energy crisis, but there was no 
indication they would break their stalemate.

Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy, 
arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of 
the crisis.

Davis contends federal energy regulators are ignoring their mandate to ensure 
``just and fair'' electricity prices.

With no sign of a break in the deadlock, each side maneuvered for maximum 
advantage from Bush's first full day in California as president.

Davis, in an interview Tuesday on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' defended 
his record on licensing more power plants.

``We've licensed 15 plants. Ten are under construction, four will be online 
this summer, four next summer, and by the end of 2003 we will have built our 
way out of this problem. But between now and then, we are getting gouged 
unbelievably,'' Davis said.

The Bush administration timed positive energy announcements to coincide with 
the president's visit.

At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, Bush was announcing the expansion 
of a program that provides federal money to help low-income residents pay for 
power.

Bush was proposing $150 million, in addition to $300 million already budgeted 
for a component of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to provide 
special help to cash-strapped residents of California and certain Midwest 
areas such as Chicago, a senior administration aide said.

Bush was also reminding state residents of his order that military facilities 
in the state cut peak-hour usage by 10 percent.

To alleviate an electricity bottleneck on a crucial south-north transmission 
path, the Department of Energy announced that the Western Area Power 
Authority will try to raise money from a variety of private and public 
entities to finance a crucial additional lines.

``The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a 
long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,'' 
said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. ``California's electricity problems 
developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we 
can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from 
recurring year after year.''

Davis had a letter for Bush from top economists who maintain price caps are 
justified and necessary.

Aides to the governor expressed amazement that Bush would travel all the way 
to California with no major announcement in hand, and predicted Davis would 
respond with ``polite rage.''

Mindful of the national stage he commanded, Davis planned a news conference 
to air his grievances. And he convened a panel of families he said have been 
victimized by the energy crisis in the same hotel where Bush was staying.

Davis wants Bush to pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
impose stiff price caps.

Tuesday, limited caps ordered last month by FERC go into effect in 
California, but only when electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent in the 
state - a step Davis called inadequate.

Protesters planned demonstrations in Los Angeles and at Camp Pendleton, in 
San Diego County.

Bush also arranged a speech on energy and trade to the Los Angeles World 
Affairs Council and planned to president over a closed-door energy 
round-table discussion.

Appeals court declines to order energy price caps

Updated: May 29, 2001 - 12:22 p.m. 
SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court declined Tuesday to order federal
energy regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices. 

The decision by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
came hours before California Gov. Gray Davis was to urge President Bush in
Century City to cap wholesale power costs, which have been spiraling out of
control. 

The panel, in a brief statement, said last week's appeal by state Senate
President John Burton and state Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg does not
warrant "intervention of this court." 

The lawmakers, both Democrats, were joined by the city of Oakland in their
appeal to the 9th Circuit. 

"The citizens of California are suffering immediate irreparable harm as a
result of FERC's abrogation of its duty to establish just and reasonable
rates for electricity," they wrote to the 9th Circuit, which has
jurisdiction over FERC. 

The lawmakers said California's looming threat of continued blackouts "are
an imminent threat to the health, welfare and safety of every California
citizen." 

The suit came after more than a year of wholesale power prices reaching
historically high levels. In December, prices in California reached $200 per
megawatt hour -- and they have skyrocketed to as much as $1,900 per megawatt
hour during peak times since then. 

The Bush administration ardently opposes price caps and President Bush has
declined Davis' requests to urge FERC to impose strict caps. 

Vice President Dick Cheney, chief architect of the administration's energy
plan, has said capping prices would not increase energy supplies or reduce
demand. 

"We get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there
is some kind of conspiracy ... instead of dealing with the real issues,"
Cheney has said. 

Cheney criticized Davis, a Democrat, for what he called a "harebrained
scheme" to use the state's budget surplus to buy power because California's
two largest utilities face enormous financial problems. 

For the short term, the Bush administration has approved Davis' request to
expedite permits for new power plants and has ordered federal facilities in
California to reduce energy consumption 10 percent this summer. 

Sacramento and the White House appear locked in a high-voltage war of
rhetoric over energy policies. There is broad bipartisan dissatisfaction in
Sacramento with Washington's response to California's energy crisis -- the
result of its own 1996 deregulation rules. 

Last month FERC did order a one-year cap on electricity sold into California
during power emergencies, when power reserves fall below 7 1/2 percent. The
agency did not set a price and also required the state to join a regional
transmission organization, which could limit California's ability to control
its own power grid. 

Davis called the plan a "Trojan horse," and state power regulators dismissed
the cap as inadequate, saying it would profit power generators at
ratepayers' expense. 

In addition, Davis and state lawmakers sharply criticized FERC for
considering requiring the state's power grid operator to add a surcharge on
power sales to pay generators the money they are owed by the state's two
large financially strapped utilities. 

The case is Burton v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 01-70812.

I just got a call from Sandra Yamane at Marathon -- she just talked to their 
client who was at the CEO meeting w/ Bush, Davis and Riordan.  Each 
participant had two minutes to speak -- all focused on technology and energy 
efficiency.  The media was allowed to come into the meeting at the end.  
Craig Barrett emerged as the spokesman and he said the group unanimously was 
opposed to price caps.  Davis said very little, and Riordan said nothing.   
Davis' press conference is being televised right now on CNN.

Thanks very much Scott.  Could you also forward to the SF office.  Much 
appreciated.

Status of core/noncore proposal
Buzz about the proposal in Sacramento is still significant and growing.
Our name is being tossed about, but in the context (apparently) of "some 
parts of Enron's core/noncore proposal."
Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.

Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor
Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors)
They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats 
IOU past due) using their MOU numbers.
They said that the model "can work" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this 
is pretty consistent with our analysis).
Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me 
the results tomorrow AM.
Hertzberg is coming up with "additional" twists, however.
The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates 
down).
Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $20B of 
additional debt (the MOU would issue about $13B).
In addition, Hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 20 years (the MOU would 
issues 15-year paper)----Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market won't 
buy 20-year paper.
Hoffman & Co. continue to work on the DWR creditworthiness issue (if not done 
by July, they'll lose the contracts they've signed, which have out clauses in 
the event that credit isn't in place by July)

Conversation with the Chamber
The Chamber of Commerce called and I re-iterated (again) the key features of 
our core/noncore proposal (as opposed to other features being tossed about, 
e.g., cost-shifting).
They were very appreciative, liked the features of our proposal (again) and 
we agreed to stay in close contact.

Finally, I have a call into Hertzberg to see what else I can learn.

Best,
Jeff

What time's the show?  Do we know what station?  Here are my points:

Stop the blame; stop the political rhetoric.
If there's evidence that manipulation has occured, produce it--the 
investigations have been going on for a year.  Stop the McCarthyist tactics.
Californians want a real, comprehensive solution that is bi-partisan
More supply
Less demand
No state takeovers; state out of procurement now.
A real energy market place (competition and choice)
Creditworthy utilities (prices that reflect the true cost of power)

you win the big prize!

I've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation Hertzberg made to the his 
caucus.  Unfortunately, it's a fax and hardly legible.  I can make out, 
however, that it is the core/noncore plan.  I'm attempting to get a better 
copy and will distribute as soon as I get my hands on it.  Please keep 
confidential that we have a copy.  Thanks.

Folks:

Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous 
note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy 
that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.

Best,

P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; 
Hertzberg has it at about 20%.

Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt

N231235.DTL 
Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern 
California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at 
the expense of its biggest customers. 
The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial 
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion 
back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users 
would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. 
Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but 
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should shoulder the costs it created. 
"We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these 
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any 
problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). 
Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put 
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. 
Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP 
lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. 
The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and 
"noncore" users. 
SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS
Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core 
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be those using more than 500 kilowatts. 
Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. 
But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. 
Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- 
term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar 
panels, on contract with the utility. 
That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of 
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity. 
Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to 
buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to 
make themselves energy self-sufficient. 
The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy 
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. 
During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users 
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would 
shift exclusively to the big users. 
Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be 
given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper rates. 
Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users 
because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. 
Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. 
EDISON 'ENCOURAGED'
Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out 
details of the plan. 
A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. 
"I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice 
president with Edison. "They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and 
trying to find a solution." 
Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there 
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. 
"We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will 
experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a 
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. 
"When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another 
potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," 
Smith said. 
Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying 
the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. 
They don't want voters to pay because they vote." 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business 
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto 
residential and smaller commercial customers. 
"I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public 
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big 
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," 
Rosenfield said. 
The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of 
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. 
Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that 
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. 
Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state 
purchase of transmission lines. 
In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the 
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. 
In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to 
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, 
for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

Municipal utilities warned 
Governor says he'll seize excess electricity if prices don't come down 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Thursday, May 31, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/31/MN154796.DTL 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power 
generated by California's municipal utility districts, which he said have 
charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators. 
Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility 
districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the average 
wholesale cost demanded by private power companies. 
The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2 power 
alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and 
skyrocketing electricity prices. So far this year, the state has paid more 
than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities. 
In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state 
generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor said 
he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally 
owned utilities if they do not lower their prices. 
He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance. 
"We're going to get that power one way or another," Davis said. 
Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. In Northern California, 
there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento and 
Santa Clara. Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state. 
30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS 
For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details 
of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing with 
generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilities. 
He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects full 
details to be made available within 30 days. 
Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis and 
other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents, 
insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations. 
The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the 
contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being 
spent. 
RUDE AWAKENING
While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing Davis 
needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emulate 
the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets. 
Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince 
municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis 
insisted they are required to do by law. 
He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them 
explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as 
California faces a summer of potential blackouts. 
The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed "to make 
most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices 
significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market." 
Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration. 
Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still "trying very hard to 
promote this notion that we're all in this together." 
While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most 
aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how 
much the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800 
megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways. 
Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes. 
Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for 
comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities 
Association in Sacramento. 
"I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or 
involuntarily," the governor said. 
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play 
ball. To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way. 
In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California 
municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and 
Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in 
rolling blackouts during power shortages. 
"I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can 
turn on their lights somewhere else," said Alan Vallow, director of the 
utility serving Lodi's 58,000 residents.

It's simple.  Purchase.......I mean Pool.......well, purchase can be better 
sometimes.

I love you too.  I have been working on purchase versus pooling all day.
I'm about to lose my mind.

Thanks. I should be there about 7.  You know that I love you very much,
Prentice.

Puh-leez.  We did the plastic and the rocks to avoid weeding.  How can there 
be any weeding?  Unfortunately we can't stop by on the way up, but likely on 
the way back, which may be Saturday night.  If so, do you guys wan't to play

Just in from watering the west 40.  I think this is going to be our best
year ever - lookin' good, lookin' good.  However, there is some serious
weeding that someone needs to do!!!

I am presuming you guys are stopping in Napa before your dome trek (which is
why I thought I could give you a check immediately!).  Is that the case?  If
so, I hope you can join us in a nummy little repast!  If not, I will put a
check in the mail when you let me know the amount.  Unlike some, I always
carry my checkbook with me!

Well, get out there and weed, then.   Can't take Annie (too short a trip).  
I'm pretty sure that we'll be there.  Make tee times for 9 am?  You can wait 
till we see you to pay.  They did charge corkage---just a nice, not too 
expensive place.

There are a few pesky little weeds around some - not all - the tomatoes.
Lots around the melons, some in the herbs and flowers.  So you are not
taking Annie with you??  Please scout around for Liz Whiting's car keys.
They were in her purse and she can't find them now.  Look under the beds
etc. upstairs if you would please.

It had to be more than $50 per person!!!  Did they not charge the
corkage????????  Shall I mail you a check or wait till you are in  Napa?  We
would love to play golf Sunday - I will make a time if you are sure you will
be there - what time would you like??

That shirt?????????  Puh-leez.

Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt

Jeff,

Regarding your voice mail, here is information on today's Dunn hearing:

While today's hearing is still going on, here is what transpired with
Edward Kahn as of 2:40 p.m..

Kahn went over his previously released SCE sponsored report on
withholding.  He discounted the Mirant sponsored Hogan report as
inconclusive and indicated that he will be releasing a response
shortly.  Kahn indicated that Tim Belden refuted his report at a meeting
in Santa Fe but that Tim would not "predictably" release hard copies of
his report.  Kahn also referenced an Enron document addressing his
report contained in an Enron FERC filing.  Senator Dunn told his staff
to make note of Tim's name and the reports.

Senator Dunn indicated that the committee is now in possession of
confidential ISO documents.

Regarding Pescetti, he called Smutney, Gary Ackerman and I into a
meeting.  Gary did not show up.  Anthony discussed four items he is
considering legislatively:

1) Edison deal minus the assets with a rate cap.  He is concerned that
if SCE goes under the state will implement the PPA through drastic
measures.
2) Establishing a 15 month cost-plus rate cap with one condition, the
state must build 10,000 mw within the 15 months or the cap will be
lifted.
3) Direct access (I told him to talk to Dave Kelley before he does
anything)
4) Expedited Path 15 legislation, perhaps with partial generator
funding.

He expressed interest in real time metering as a means to increase
conservation.  Smutney suggested using part of the PPA money to install
meters for all customers.  I told him Enron used these meters with great
success for the industrials.  Anthony had some concern with reliability
so I told him I would get information.  I'm working with Elizabeth
Linell on this.

He also expressed interest in buy-down so I gave him Enron's plan.

Anthony said he is working alone on these proposals.

Folks:

Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous 
note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy 
that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; 
Hertzberg has it at about 20%.

Here's the document that I received from the lobbyist today.  It's the same 
document that I distributed internally yesterday.

A little something we got our hands on.....
 - Assembly Demo Plan.doc

To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today.  
I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore 
structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes 
sense.  I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings 
with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.

Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan 
that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.  They view it as unfair and 
punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it 
simply to "make the deal Harvey proof."  Many questioned Keeley about why the 
Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.  Keely said that the Assembly 
is also trying to come up with something that will get support from the 
Senate (read "Burton").

Keely also mentioned our name in a list of many names as sources of 
information used to build the proposal.

Best,
Jeff
I attended the Chamber meeting today and the  discussion focused on P.R. 
efforts for large users focusing on core and non-core opposition. Bob Foster 
with Edison made a presentation regarding support of M.O.U. and Fred Keeley 
came in and described Hertzberg's Plan B which mostly emphasized direct 
access. Hertzberg's Plan B was not particularly well received by the user 
groups. More details later.

1.  Just wanted to let you know that not every Californian agrees with our  
Attorney General. 
2. Read with interest a Dow Jones story regarding about a 4 page proposal  
Enron gave to Speaker Hertzberg allowing large commercial customers. 
3.  Would love to see that proposal. 
4.  Thanks.

FYI.  Did we talk to Leopold?  Might be useful to stress that that under 
noncore/core (like Direct Access), customers choose from among a host of 
competing providers for their service, not just Enron.

California Lawmakers Eye Billing Businesses for Edison Rescue 
By Jason Leopold 
? 
18:00 ET 
Dow Jones Business News 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for 
rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would 
be on the hook. 
In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied 
efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering 
ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers 
to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this 
week. 
The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly 
Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape 
as formal proposals. But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so 
"desperate" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California 
Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into 
bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse 
residential consumers out of the equation. 
"The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for 
deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing 
out Edison," the aide said. "We're looking to take the burden off of 
residential ratepayers." 
The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call Thursday is 
to designate Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as 
non-core customers. Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500 
kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of 
power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale 
market. The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its 
$5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills. 
Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market 
as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate 
themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts. 
Enron Pushing Access to Customers 
Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks 
to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California 
Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its 
residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Messrs. 
Burton and Hertzberg said. 
An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to 
Mr. Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial 
customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron. Enron also has 
recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the 
California Chamber of Commerce. 
Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with 
companies like Enron for their power. 
Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was 
scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in 
place of the utilities. 
The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as 
alternatives to a memorandum of understanding Mr. Davis struck with Edison in 
April. The MOU -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle 
reached in February -- has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who 
have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement 
forward. 
State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate 
energy committee, said there are so many "Plan B's" floating around the 
Legislature that, "We're going to need to hire an apiculturist." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said the Davis administration 
is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of 
understanding move through the Legislature, but said separating the utility's 
"core and non-core" customers would be at the forefront of new discussions. 
It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan, he said. 
Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the 
chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the 
Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is "a very bad idea" that 
could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity. 
"This [plan] would really screw businesses," Mr. DiMare said. "We just got 
hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our 
businesses to other states."

Greetings Senator:

I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your 
message has been forwarded to him.

In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to 
business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks 
ago.  It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does 
include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right 
answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker 
Hertzberg).  

Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to 
Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and 
met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss 
solutions to California's electricity crisis.

But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's 
San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's 
past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company 
believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have 
been incurred on their behalf.

I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our 
proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule 
permits.  I'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you 
would like to talk before Monday.

If there's anything else I can do, or if you have any questions, don't 
hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff Dasovich

I didn't talk to Jason on this one.  I'll check w/ Mark, but I doubt he would 
know what we gave to Hertzberg and the chamber.  It's odd that Jason said 
Enron "executive" since if he talks to me or Mark, he uses "spokesman" or 
uses our names... I think Davis's new hit men are really trying to paint us 
as the evil empire...

Not at all.  Should I talk to Jason on background and set him straight?

Municipal utilities lambaste Davis threat to seize power 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Friday, June 1, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/01/MN17670.DTL 
California municipal utilities reacted with shock and anger yesterday to Gov. 
Gray Davis' threat to seize their excess power if they did not slash prices 
to below-market rates. 
"I feel totally betrayed," said George Fraser, general manager of the 
Northern California Power Agency, an association of 14 municipal utilities. 
"It's clear to me that the governor doesn't understand the power business." 
This new dimension to the state's energy woes came as authorities issued 
their first one-hour warning of imminent blackouts in the Bay Area, only to 
cancel the warning an hour later when additional power supplies were found. 
Davis told The Chronicle in an interview Wednesday that some city-owned 
municipal utilities had charged even higher electricity prices than the 
out-of- state generators he has accused of gouging California consumers. 
He said he was prepared to use his executive authority "to get that power one 
way or another" if the utilities did not lower their prices. The state so far 
has spent more than $8 billion buying electricity on behalf of cash- strapped 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison. 
"What the governor said makes no sense whatsoever," said Jerry Jordan, 
executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association. "He was 
definitely off-base." 
Jordan said most municipal utilities already provided all surplus power to 
California's electricity market. 
However, he said, the municipals buy power at market rates to meet their own 
shortfalls, and thus have a responsibility to their customers -- local city 
residents -- to sell any excess supplies at the same sky-high price levels. 
"Our utilities are going to do what they can to help the state of 
California," Jordan said. "But they aren't going to do that at the expense of 
customers." 
Davis' threat followed a meeting last week with the heads of about a dozen 
municipal utilities. Participants said the tone of the discussion was 
generally cordial, and it was understood the governor's office would work up 
a plan for future electricity purchases. 
Davis' threat came out of the blue, they said. 
"We're willing to sell our excess power," said John Roukema, assistant 
director of Silicon Valley Power in Santa Clara. "But we have to deal with 
the same market conditions that the governor does." 
Davis doesn't see it that way. He believes that many municipal utilities are 
exploiting California's power shortage in the same way that out-of-state 
generators are walking off with billions of dollars in windfall profits. 
The governor's top energy adviser, S. David Freeman, said in an interview 
yesterday that Davis' threat to seize the municipals' power was intended as a 
reminder that the state expected prompt action on the issue. 
"We want to be sure that the municipals are not just talking the talk but 
doing what they say," Freeman said. 
He said municipal utilities should be selling surplus power at the same level 
it cost to generate electricity, plus a reasonable markup of about 15 
percent. 
Freeman finds himself in a somewhat awkward position on the matter. Before 
signing on with the Davis administration, he was head of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, by far the state's largest municipal utility. 
The Los Angeles department has been accused by both federal and state 
officials of charging some of the highest prices of all for electricity. 
Earlier this year, it was asking as much as $1,400 per megawatt hour for its 
output. 
Frank Salas, the department's chief operating officer, said such prices were 
necessitated by high production expenses. "We were just recovering our 
costs," he said. 
For his part, Freeman insisted that no such pricing had occurred on his 
watch. 
"There was tremendous pressure on me to charge more," he said of urgings from 
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other local officials for higher 
profits, demands that Freeman said he had resisted. 
"That pressure may have increased now that I'm gone," he said. "I don't know 
what they're doing now." 
The Department of Water and Power's Salas countered that Freeman should know 
exactly what his former colleagues were doing. "We have the same pricing 
structure now that we had when he was boss," he said. 
Fraser at the Northern California Power Agency said it was strange that Davis 
would be so aggressive in his dealings with the municipals, which provide 
only about 15 percent of the state's power needs. 
"He's kicking the little guy," he said. "He's picking on us because he can."

I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 
24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one 
that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 
100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision 
of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.

The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have 
recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They 
are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have 
requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that 
Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will 
get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear 
something.

Carolyn Kepplinger (sp?) is calling me---no doubt to talk about 
core/noncore.  Her number's 202.383.2119.  You want to take it? (I hope you 
say yes.)

In a hearing off the Floor this afternoon, the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee voted on a partisan basis (14-7) to pass AB 2xx (Corbett), which 
would enact a gross receipts tax on power generators.  Please note that three 
amendments were adopted by the author:  (1) exempt state contracts (not all 
long-term contracts like SB 1xx does) and the taxpayer would have to go to 
DWR for this exemption; (2) taxpayer would get a credit for any similar tax 
paid in another state (assuming other states will actually enact windfall 
profits tax bills; (3) PUC will adjust the base price quarterly (rather than 
"from time-to-time").
Next stop is the Assembly Floor, planned for Thursday morning.

In a hearing off the Floor this afternoon, the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee voted on a partisan basis (14-7) to pass AB 81 (Migden), which 
would make power plants state-assessed.  Please note that two amendments were 
adopted by the author:  (1) allocate property tax revenues derivbed from 
state-assessed property according to the same formula used by county 
assessors "in order to hold local agencies harmless."  (2) Exempt 
qualififying facilities from the bill "because QFs have never been subject to 
state assessment."  The bill will be on the Floor for Thursday morning's 
session.

Hello Comrades:

Round two of the admission process is onto the
acceptance stage and Diane has called upon us again to
rally round the phones and corral these new admits. 
We have about 85, so with 7 of us, that translates to
about 12 contacts apiece.

Please confirm your willingness and availibility so I
can send out the lists ASAP.  TJ tells me that they
want these calls made this week.

Thanks, again  (and you thought you were enjoying your
summer--except for the Enron manager, of course)  ;-]

Hi Jeff, 

Sorry to hear about the hair.  Did not change
companies, but got a nice promotion a couple of months
ago.  We just started using the new server last month
so we can have our own company address for email,
hence the new email moniker.

Thanks for getting back to me.  If we are still
working on it next week, I will let you know.

I sent the Pilot Proposal and cover letter out today by email after final
approval by Ian.  I will followup on Monday to find out what their
evaluation gameplan is and to suggest meetings so that we can get ROI
inputs to allow James to workup an ROI proposal.

Check the PUC website for information---it sounds like the PUC's inquiry into 
the adequacy of SoCal's insfrastructure, i.e., in state transportation.  
Should be a lot about it on their website (www.cpuc.ca.gov).  If you come up 
empty, leave me a voicemail (415.782.7822) and I'll track things down.

All I know is as follows    On March 27,2001 the Commission issued a scoping 
memo in 00-11-002.  The scoping memo added the issue of the adequacy of 
SoCal's transmission system to the issues to be addressed in this proceeding.

An ALJ ruling dated April 26,2001, provided that the adequacy of SoCal's gas 
transmission system and the effect on its customers be bifurcated from the 
other issues in this proceeding.  The ALJ's ruling provided that any party 
filing testimony on March 23,2001 would be allowed to file supplemental 
testimony on the SoCal capacity issue.

SoCal filed supplemental testimony.

We are not a party. We need to know if it is too late to become a party, if 
we wanted to. Also was any other supplemental testimony filed by other 
parties??

We're on at 9:30 AM California time.  I'll call you early in the AM to 
confirm, coordinate, ruminate, etc.

There you go again, always demanding substance.

I'll fill you in tomorrow on why it's so high level (and repetitive).  
Believe it or not, Larry Ellison (CEO Oracle) and Scott McNealy (CEO Sun) is 
the audience--neither's real up to speed on the industry.

PS How's the cover memo for the strategy coming?

The meeting between Skilling & the Governor went well.  He's intrigued about 
the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet.  Governor and his 
folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be 
another call next Monday.  Will fill you in as things progress.  Thanks again 
for the pricing sheet.  Please keep all of this highly confidential.

As my mother likes to say, "You should be on the stage....

the one that left an hour ago."

I was worried about this.  Sent it Monday night.  Kept getting bounced back.  
Could you page me at 888.916.7184 and let me know that you get it?  I'm in 
Portland.  Also, got Ginger's message re: paragraph on TW deal.  Steffes said 
you didnt' need right away because EBR got cancelled.  When do you need and 
do you want just background, or valuation calculations, too? Thanks.

Jeff/Sue, what are your thoughts about trying to meet with commissioners or 
key staff to advance our quite reasonable positions in the DG case?  The 
Phase 1 ruling is only a month away.  It still baffles me that such contacts 
are permissible, but obviously the utilities are doing whatever they can to 
oppose our positions on UDC ownership, open access D tariffs, and standby 
rates.

Attached are the high tech slides with the correct figure for dollars that  
the high tech sector spent on electricity in 1999.

Dad/Eldon is going to get some Acacia Chardonnay for $5 per bottle.  We had 
some at Hopkins last night and it was really very good.  It is unlabeled but 
it is Acacia chard.  I know you don't drink a lot of white wine - but you 
might want some around.  Let us know - he needs to order it before he goes 
and he is going to try to go tomorrow.
Cameron - I need a few days to make any arrangements you want me to do in 
Italy - so please let me know.  
I will be out of the office the rest of the day.  Home around 6 or 7.

"Plus je bois, mieux je chante" 

I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I 
can't recall, I'm sending to all.

First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet 
Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized 
her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the 
"clarifications" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, 
and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The 
answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the 
report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).  

My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez 
that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a 
fatal flaw--significant probability.)

Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable 
variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the 
answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet, 
beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)

Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with 
something remotely similar.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks, Sarah.  Question:  Could we, and should we, attempt to pre-empt the 
FERC report and try to get press coverage of the BP paper before FERC 
releases the results of its investigation?

	Sarah Novosel
	10/04/2000 11:58 AM
		 
This is just a rumor, but we heard on the EPSA call today that Scott Miller 
is trying to get his report on the California part of his investigation to 
the Commissioners by Friday of this week.  

Also, the EPSA/Boston Pacific paper continues to be revised, but EPSA wants 
to get it to FERC as soon as possible (but if Scott completes his report by 
Friday it may not be in time for Scott's report), so they have asked us to 
review the report and Executive Summary and get comments back to them for a 
conference call on Friday.  Since we will be at FERC during the EPSA call, we 
will need to get any comments we may have to Julie by Thursday evening or 
Friday morning.

Thanks everyone.

How real do you need?  It is Acacia chard that was supposed to be special 
labeled which means it was done for a restaurant or some special client and 
some of the deals fell through!  It's not the best but it is very good 
especially for the price!  Are you going with PP to do the cheese or does the 
cheese shopper stand alone?

Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the 
best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our 
powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my 
view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.

Also, one question:

Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have 
that right?

If you have any questions, don't hesitate.

Hey, no problem.  I'll call Badeer.

I didn't mean to send that last e-mail to Steve.  Whoops.

Steve:  Let me know if you'd like to discuss.  I like Tim's idea re: maybe 
you should take the slot.   But in my view definitely not Skilling.  I think 
you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with 
Schroeder re: Littlechild.  

Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).  I 
had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind 
contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost 
of providing gratis.  I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am 
surprised to see it turn up in print.  

Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about 
this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.  In 
fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one 
but that we're always interested in working together.

Jeff, I sent this e-mail to Kean last night.  I am fine with your 
recommendation for Skilling to pass on this event.  Do you want to deliver 
the news to Lee.  Do we want to offer you, Steve Kean, or me as an 
alternative?  Personally, I would like to attend but don't have much interest 
in speaking (assuming that they would allow low lifes like you or me to 
speak).  Your call on all of this.  Call bob Badeer with questions about the 
BEEP as I am heading out of town in a couple of hours.

I just received this e-mail from a former professor of mine at Berekely.  
Dasovich knows more about this than I do, so you should definitely talk to 
him.  Do you think that this is something that Skilling should attend?

Jeff and Tim,

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk "Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation."

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

Still holding out hope that my Hollywood career will take off -- we 
supermodels do occasionally get speaking roles.

Between you and me, I don't think California is an option at this point.

Couple of thoughts:

In light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today, seems 
that the IOUs have decided to up the ante considerably (likely in response to 
a pounding they're taking from Wall Street). This will likely increase the 
pressure for Davis to act sooner rather than later, at least w.r.t. finding a 
way out of the IOU undercollection problem.   The increased pressure to act 
in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge.   Regarding 
the call on Monday with Davis, the added heat being applied might argue for 
coming up with a simple, concrete proposal that we can hand to Davis and that 
he can implement immediately to get the IOUs off his back and avoid having 
the adminstration cook up something less preferable.

I doubt that anyone in accounting has it, and I'm not sure to whom in 
accounting to send it.  Suggestions?  I think that Bowen & Co. could likely 
help us out on this first filing.  Also, Sue, regarding NY:  I have a call 
into Bowen but when I called they sounded pretty tied up.  Haven't heard back 
yet.

Hi Jeff,

I just saw the fax regarding the quarterly fee statement for reimbursement 
account for California.  Do you know if there is someone in accounting who 
has the document and who has responsibility for taking care of it?  Thanks,

Sue

FYI.  According to Roger, if the freeze is extended out toward 2004 for PG&E 
and Edison, his book makes BIG money.

FYI.  Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in 
California.  Been trading messages.  When she gets back to me with what she 
wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation.  
Question:  What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the 
intent of getting her to do a story on it?  She might be a good "carrier."  
Thoughts?  One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.

Best,
Jeff

Here's the next version of the slides.  Few points:

There are a few holes (pre-quals and process in particular)--my brain began 
to fail.  But I think there's enough of a structure so that we can easily 
finalize by tomorrow.
I didn't have an electronic version of Whaley's slides, so I couldn't 
integrate them.  But I don't think it will take much to do the integration.
Some of Whaley's slides have a strong marketing slant--we should think hard 
about whether we include them lest we lose our mantle of objectivity.
We still have some wordsmithing to do re: participate, run the auction, or 
participate and run the auction.

Best,

Agree completely.  Notion I had was that we give Rebecca the slides, tell her 
the story on background, then she trots off to interview McNeally, Ellison, 
etc.  Just a thought.  Might be easier, faster channel that achieves the 
quick action/message we're looking for.

I don't disagree with Jeff that the WSJ would be a great message point.  I 
would recommend, however, that one of Enron's allies interview for the 
story.  For Enron to speak for the hi-tech industry is a bit questionable.  
Better if we can approach Intel or Sun now and ask them to talk with R. Smith.

Anyone out there know why FERC has asked the PX for still more data?

Richard:  

Looks good.  One comment:  Under the section "Generating Documents:  Requests 
12, 14 and 18,"  I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph 
starting with "For Portland General..." and not the "alternate ending."  To 
further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty 
extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has 
a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of 
increased wholesale purchases.  Paul Kaufman would have details of the 
request.

Hope your son's doing well.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.

 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

BEEP stack is the supply curve for real-time energy that the ISO develops on 
the basis of bids and offers.  The problem is that the plants the ISO 
ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order 
developed from the bids/offers, and the ISO has never been clear about the 
decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch.  Everyone, including 
Belden, thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent.

does tomorrow work?

Yes, will be on call.

I apologize for being tardy.  I can have my IRS to you by Monday.

Hi Delaney:

I won't need a room.  Did you want me to participate on a panel?  If so, 
which day and at what time?  Who else will be on the panel?  Inquiring minds 
would love to know.

Susan Scott is a senior attorney with the pipeline group (TW).  I met her as 
part of the California PUC's gas restructuring case.  For some time she's 
been inquiring about Government Affairs.  She called me yesterday and 
mentioned that she's very  interested in exploring if there are any 
opportunities in GA.  From my experience, Susan is highly competent and very 
professional and I think TW would say the same.  She likes her work but wants 
a new challenge.  I told her I'd inquire about whether someone would be 
interested in talking with her. I think that it would be useful for you to 
chat with her.  Thoughts?  Susan would like to keep it confidential at this 
point.

I don't think that the stranded cost issue has been squarely addressed.

Has Sue gotten in touch with you.  And have you contacted Tim Belden in 
Portland?  He is the absolute guru on this stuff.

Lee:  I'm not certain that it will be possible to get Skilling, but I'll get 
back to you soon.  Also, I want to manage expectations a bit about the 
possibility of having Enron stream the conference.  Just don't want us to get 
ahead of ourselves.  I'd prefer that it not go out in any announcement at 
this juncture.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff and Tim,

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk "Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation."

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

Couple of brief comments:

1) There is a new and growing drum beat to reduce California's wholesale 
price caps further (i.e., below $250, with some suggesting $100).  We need to 
discuss strategy very soon.
2)  I'm attempting to arrange a meeting between ENA (Calger) and Sempra (CFO) 
to discuss commercial opportunities.

FYI. Great news.  PUC "fixed" the language glitches in the original decision 
granting ETI its certificate and voted it out yesterday.  So we're good to go 
on filing our final tariff.  It's attached.  Please take a look and let's 
discuss ASAP (Monday?) so we can get if on file at the CPUC.

Lara--I reviewed this report as well as the memo that Illinois counsel 
prepared for you.  A number of questions/concerns come to mind.  I briefly 
discussed these concerns with Sue Nord late last week, but wanted to put them 
before the group for possible discussion on our next conference call. 

When I read the memo from Stamos (Illinois counsel), it appeared to me that 
the categories of requirements might be able to be divided into "regulatory" 
responsibilities vs "commercial" requirements.  In the regulatory column 
would be things like the annual designation of an agent and the annual 
identification of the CEO.  Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed 
every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart)  Other 
items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax 
contributions might fall into the commercial category.

These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but 
there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated 
with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications.  And 
are there penalties in place if we don't comply?  

Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call?

 

   Lara Leibman                08/23/2000 01:42 PM

Attached please find a chart that summarizes the differences between IXC and 
CLEC obligations for Texas, New York and Illinois.  This project was meant to 
incorporate California and Florida; however, I have not yet received any 
information from our counsel in CA and I only received the pertinent 
information from our counsel in Florida late last night and this morning.  I 
apologize that I was not able to include any information from those states.  
I will incorporate their information when I return from vacation.

I have asked Gloria to provide some of you with copies of the material that I 
received from Florida  to utilize in my absence (e.g., Sue, Donald, Scott).  
You should already have the material from TX, IL and NY.  

Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns.  Thank you.

Lara

Paul,

I've put out a request to some of them to get together and will follow up.  
One problem is that talking to Jerry Jordan or Tony Braun will be liking 
talking to a wall.  I think we need to get with some of the other, more sane 
members of the muni community. 
What is anyone hearing about how this is being received?  In my view, the 
best thing that could happen is that it gets ignored and they become further 
irrelevant.   If anyone in the legislature or elsewhere is taking this at all 
seriously, then we definitely ought to try to meet with them.   Having said 
that, this has S. David Freeman written all over it, and between him and 
Jordan, I don't hold out much hope for  changing their views.

Will do.

Prentice ever get back to you regarding logistics about tomorrow nite?  What 
time is dinner by the way. I'm supposed to do something from 3-4, but could 
come up directly thereafter.

Rebecca Smith called.  She wants to have coffee on Monday at 10 AM 
California.  Topics:  1) How California got here.  2) How California can get 
out of it.  

Any chance of talking Monday AM prior to 10 AM California time?  I think I've

know.

Hear's a message I'm practicing:

"Shapiro and Steffes went to FERC on Friday----problem solved."

Edison International CFO Disputes 'Technical Insolvency' Claim
By Mark Golden
  
10/03/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's treasurer and chief financial 
officer, Ted Craver, disputed Tuesday a claim made last week that 
California's utilities risk "technical insolvency" in 2001. 
Since May, California's three investor-owned utilities have been spending far 
more to purchase needed electricity than they are getting paid by customers. 
As a result, the undercollections in the "transition revenue account" of 
Edison's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, grew by $1.97 
billion between May 1 and August 31, the company reported to the Securities 
Exchange Commission. 
An article Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow 
Jones & Co., said that "if the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed 
the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently 
seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year." 
"The way this term was used insinuated that you take the transition revenue 
account, and whatever the gross number is equates to the amount of debt that 
you would have to raise," Craver said in an interview. "That is not at all 
the way it works. That is not an accurate portrayal." 
California Gov. Gray Davis acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying, 
"California consumers have a legitimate need for California's utilities to 
remain solvent, and the state must be committed toward that end." 
But Edison's Craver said the situation is not that simple. 
"That transition revenue account balance says nothing about what we have to 
fund in the market," Craver said. "Southern California Edison has some 37 
balancing and memo accounts set up by the California Public Utilities 
Commission. What we have to fund is the net amount of all of them, plus 
whatever else is going on, and the net figure is considerably smaller than 
the $1.97 billion. It's like picking out one line item on the balance sheet 
and saying this is all that matters. No accountant does that or looks at it 
that way." 
Craver also said that the term "technical insolvency" has no specific meaning 
to him. 
A PG&E Corp (PCG) spokesman declined to comment when asked this week if it 
risks technical insolvency next year. The company is seeking refunds from 
independent generators that have been selling power to the state's utilities, 
and for the future it has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
consider a return to cost-based pricing specific to each generating station 
in the state. 
Utility bond analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about California utility 
debt. 
"I don't believe the utilities are going to go bankrupt, but they don't have 
any assurance from the legislature, governor or regulators," Bear Stearns's 
Ted Olshanski said. "The uncertainty is critical." 
Bear Stearns has a negative outlook on Edison and PG&E bonds due to the 
uncertainty on the recovery of these energy costs. 
This summer's period of undercollections has continued into the fall, with 
the California's wholesale market for Wednesday power at $135 a 
megawatt-hour, compared with the $65/MWh that SCE gets from customers. 
The current best asking price for on-peak power fall all of 2001 in southern 
California is $85/MWh. 
When asked how long Edison can continue to fund the difference between its 
purchase power costs and the revenue it receives from customers, Craver 
responded: "How long can ratepayers or anyone afford those prices, which 
don't have anything to do with reality? The market mechanisms don't work." 
California's utilities are hoping to make significant changes to the market, 
and some of those changes would require action by the state legislature, 
which is out of session until December. 
"I don't know that this is something that waits for the legislature," Craver 
said. "There are a lot of things that can be done before the legislature 
meets. We have significant issues before the FERC and the CPUC." 
Olshanski said he hoped for a political solution. 
"We're not sure how its going to end," he said. "We expect regulators and 
legislators to step up and provide for a constructive resolution. In the 
past, the California legislature has approved measures to make companies 
whole."

do you have it?

Well, wouldn't you know it.  I couldn't find the most recent version in my 
email.  But here's the 10.03 version with a few edits.  Couple of other 
points:

I still very much like the idea of taking the table out and includling as an 
attachment.
I still think that the table doesn't explicitly address an option Rick may be 
thinking about "Maintain presence with fewer resources."  Think it's 
something we need to focus on.  

Have a great weekend.

Spreadsheet to follow.

I confess that I haven't even looked at the bloody thing.  How many 
questions?  Should we divide them up and pass around as usual?

received from Florida  to utilize in my absence (e.g., Sue, Donald, Scott).  
You should already have the material from TX, IL and NY.  

Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns.  Thank you.

Understanding there won't be a call on Monday, here's a draft of the auction 
slides that we've been working on for folks to review.

I'm slow, but I catch on eventually.  Steffes was fired up when he called.  
Sounds like the meeting went pretty well.  Have a good weekend.

Jeff is a very smart guy!

Rebecca Smith called.  She wants to have coffee on Monday at 10 AM 
California.  Topics:  1) How California got here.  2) How California can get 
out of it.  

Any chance of talking Monday AM prior to 10 AM California time?  I think I've 
got the messages pretty well down, but might be useful to touch base.  Let me 
know.

Hear's a message I'm practicing:

"Shapiro and Steffes went to FERC on Friday----problem solved."

Best,
Jeff

Haven't heard of them.  And I'm not aware of any new tariffs that offer those 
kinds of savings, but we'll check around.

So that we continue to drive our activities with our Public Affairs strategy, 
we have asked Alhamd to coordinate our material and project timeline.  We are 
also asking Jeanie Mandelker to take the lead in working through our 
different material to put into one look and feel.  

Please let Alhamd know of your activities so that we are able to better 
coordinate any bottlenecks.  Also, please forward to Alhamd and Jeanie all 
prior work that has been done so that they are in the loop.

Attached the original gameplan.

Hello?  I guess everyone's wrapped up in the baseball playoffs and the 
debates.  There are 4 questions.  Since the SF people did 1&2 last time and 
the East Bay contingent did 3&4, seems we can switch this time.  SF takes 
3&4; East Bay 1&2.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings.  I'm going to read the material and the case today.  Should we 
compare notes (via email) on questions 3&4 by tomorrow (Sunday) before 
lunch?  Let me know.

Here's a very rough shot at #'s 3&4.  I think 4's worded very strangely (thus 
my strange answer).  Anyway, thought I'd throw something together to get the 
ball rolling.  I'll keep thinking about and send another dispatch later today 
or first thing tomorrow morning.

Looks good, Kim.  Thanks.

I've got a few too many speeches coming up.  You are probably in the best 
position to address this crowd (time for the student to teach the teacher), 
but I'd understand if you think it would be awkward (the we should just 
decline).

	Jeff Dasovich
	10/05/2000 01:23 PM
		
Steve:  Let me know if you'd like to discuss.  I like Tim's idea re: maybe 
you should take the slot.   But in my view definitely not Skilling.  I think 
you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with 
Schroeder re: Littlechild.  

Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).  I 
had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind 
contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost 
of providing gratis.  I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am 
surprised to see it turn up in print.  

Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about 
this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.  In 
fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one 
but that we're always interested in working together.

Best,
Jeff

	Tim Belden@ECT
	10/05/2000 01:00 PM
		 
Jeff, I sent this e-mail to Kean last night.  I am fine with your 
recommendation for Skilling to pass on this event.  Do you want to deliver 
the news to Lee.  Do we want to offer you, Steve Kean, or me as an 
alternative?  Personally, I would like to attend but don't have much interest 
in speaking (assuming that they would allow low lifes like you or me to 
speak).  Your call on all of this.  Call bob Badeer with questions about the 
BEEP as I am heading out of town in a couple of hours.

Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the 
best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our 
powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my 
view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.

Also, one question:

Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have 
that right?
I just received this e-mail from a former professor of mine at Berekely.  
Dasovich knows more about this than I do, so you should definitely talk to 
him.  Do you think that this is something that Skilling should attend?

Jeff and Tim,

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk "Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation."

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

Seems that we could provide Lay/Skilling with the power point slides as prep 
for any calls.  As a starter, it would be useful to provide McNeally with a 
letter that he could send to federal and state decision makers.

Best,
Jeff

	James D Steffes
	10/06/2000 06:47 PM
		
Jeff --

Let's see if we can get material to Lay or Skilling to call McNeally this 
week (Oct 9) so that we ask if they'll talk with Rebecca by Oct 15.  What 
exactly do we need to give to Lay or Skilling before the call?  What will 
Enron send to McNeally if he agrees?  Do we have all of this?

Jim

	Jeff Dasovich
	10/06/2000 09:55 AM
		
Agree completely.  Notion I had was that we give Rebecca the slides, tell her 
the story on background, then she trots off to interview McNeally, Ellison, 
etc.  Just a thought.  Might be easier, faster channel that achieves the 
quick action/message we're looking for.

	James D Steffes
	10/05/2000 08:30 PM
		
I don't disagree with Jeff that the WSJ would be a great message point.  I 
would recommend, however, that one of Enron's allies interview for the 
story.  For Enron to speak for the hi-tech industry is a bit questionable.  
Better if we can approach Intel or Sun now and ask them to talk with R. Smith.

FYI.  Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in 
California.  Been trading messages.  When she gets back to me with what she 
wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation.  
Question:  What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the 
intent of getting her to do a story on it?  She might be a good "carrier."  
Thoughts?  One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.

dated back to 1999.  Any other ideas?

I won't say I'm surprised by your decision, but am saddened.  On the other 
hand, you aren't rid of me yet.  I WILL be a force to be reckoned with out 
there.  (actually I should say here.  I am in San Diego again today.)

I am on the run, as usual, but will catch up with you.  Just promise me that 
Rick will buy us dinner next time I am there.

Just spent about 90 minutes with Rebecca.  She left with a very good 
understanding of our view of the problem and the solutions.  She also spent 
time asking me how I thought other players would respond to the IOU request 
for a big check to cover the undercollections.  

She expects to have a "big picture" story--covering AB 1890s past, present & 
future--completed in the next couple of weeks.  In Rebecca's words, she wants 
the story to "shake things up."  She's very upset with how the utilities are 
handling it.  I told her we were less concerned with "he said/she said" and 
more concerned with finding real short and long term solutions that are fair 
to everyone.

Mark and Karen:  In my long history with Rebecca, it has always been 
understood that our conversations are off the record and background.  
Invariably, at the end of the conversation, Rebecca tells me that she intends 
to call later and cajole the daylights out of me in an attempt to use some of 
my more colorful quotes.  It was no different this time.

If anyone wants more details, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Jimmie's the "compiler" this time.  You're stuff was good.  Whether he has 
time to incorporate remains to be seen.  But I wouldn't sweat it.  We can

getting these things done every week.

I emailed my answers to 3 and 4 as soon as I got home last night - did
you get them and did they look OK for inclusion? I read over some of the
other members answers to the same questions and it looked like we
addressed slightly different areas on #3, so we should be able to merge
them together. On #4 I think I had a slightly different answer, I'm not
sure which is right.

They've asked me to be on a gas panel.  I've said yes, but hadn't planned at 
this point on attending any of the conference other than the panel.

Bowen called, and unless he has to schedule a call with a judge from Texas at 
the same time, we're on for 9:30 AM.  He'll call back if there's a problem.  
Also, he confirmed my recollection on the dedicated transport v. AFTS and 
also confirmed that we can change any names we want and that this is the best 
time to make sure what we file in good ol' CA is consistent with our other 
filings.

The problem is not "deregulation." The fact is Oregon is not deregulated yet 
and rates are going through the roof. Also, one only needs to look back to 
1980-85 when rates in the Northwest went up 250% over a five year period 
because of nukes. This occurred in a fully regulated environment. 

The problem is that many consumers do not have a true choice to secure a 
fixed price long-term contract. 

You can not put the toothpaste back into the tube!  

I hope Enron takes the high road on this issue and pushes for expedited 
siting of new generation. The best way to accomplish this is to agree to 
compliance with emissions standards and meeting off-sets where they exist. 
Where off-sets do not exist, I think Enron can commit to paying for energy 
efficiency investments in partnership with utilities or industrial customers 
that take the out-put (or take equity) at our new plants. 

Paying for conservation, which is running about 19-22 mills in the Northwest, 
is a pretty inexpensive way to accomplish good will with end-users and 
utilities.

Hey, thanks for hanging up on me on Friday.

Hi:  I was surprised to see you at the I-House last nite.  Haven't seen you 
for a while.  Was going to drop by and say hi and catch up but your table was 
extremely popular and I didn't want to intrude.  This is the first 
travel-free week I've had in a long time.  You want to try to have lunch?  Or 
we could meet at a non-I-House place during the break and catch up if you 
like.  Dying to hear about Montana and your possible new life as a day

FYI.  
I am pulling together an answer to Larry Derrett's question concerning tax 
credits/deductions to incent companies to invest in DSM.  Am aware of recent 
California SB 970 that makes available $50 million to implement 
cost-effective energy conservation and demand-side management programs.  And 
of course there are lots of utility-specific programs that have been in place 
for a while.

Question - are you aware of any new initiatives, federal, state, or 
otherwise, that are being proposed?  Are you engaged anywhere in proposing 
such things?  Thank you.
	Marty Sunde@EES

Rick,
Could you give Larry Derrett a brief update on his question.  
Since many people in EES are asking a similar question, I'll copy Peggy 
Mahoney and ask her to use your answer as the source for communicating this 
to our employees via the BUZZ, our weekly newsletter. 
Thanks

10/09/2000 01:20 PM
Given the current political climate and concerns about adequacy of energy 
supplies, is someone at EES lobbying with politicians for certain 
arrangements which could be beneficial to our business?  For example, would 
there be interest in creating a tax credit/favorable deduction to incent 
companies to invest in DSM assets to reduce energy consumption?  I can't 
imagine that the political climate could be any better than now for a program 
like this.  

Mike:

We'd talked about getting together to discuss the bills for the case.  We'd 
originally agreed to a flat fee of $13, 500 (if memory serves) with a bonus 
for coming in under the cap.  You've sent me bills (as of August 17 according 
to my records) for over $25,000.  As you recall, we had a very lengthy 
discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings 
and associated briefs.  I stressed that $13.5 was what I'd spend and that 
we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint, which is why I 
pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset.  With that in mind, I 
believe that it's important to honor the arrangement.  However, in light of 
the particular circumstances in this case, I'm willing to exceed the previous 
arrangement for a total of $15,000, but can't go above that.  If you'd like 
to discuss it further, I'd be happy to talk about it.  Let me know.

Best,
Jeff

From street level, Commissioner McIntyre will need to take the escalator at 
Three (3) World Trade Center up to the main entrance.

Inside the double doors is a guard desk.  He needs to sign in and get a Guest

They will ask him who he is here to see and he should advise Lysa Akin and 
give them my extension at 7927.

I will then come down and escort him to the floor.

Paul, Joe, & Harry --

We've all talked about holding a meeting to outline our strategy for the next 
12 months in the Western states (wholesale and retail) and so I propose the 
following.

1. GA Strategy Meeting

We should come together as just GA before meeting with the business people.  
I think that we want to have the following people in attendance (like your 
input) - Paul Kaufman, Joe Hartsoe, Sarah Novosel, Mary Hain, Marcie Milner, 
Steve Walton, Jim Steffes, Harry Kingerski, Sue Mara, Jeff Dasovich, Bruno 
Gaillard, Mona Petrochko, Sandi McCubbin.

The meeting output would be a Strategy and Tactics Plan for June 2000 - June 
2001.

2. GA meeting w/ Business People

A few of us could go to Belden, Calger, Yang, Benevides, Condon to discuss 
the above.  

I would like to have these meetings soon (maybe Thursday, Sept 7 for #1).

Please let me know.

Are folks available for a call tomorrow at 9 AM to begin preparing for the 
meeting with Sempra next week?

Based on last nite's discussion, here's the coordinator list:

Christine--11.6--Teltronica
Dylan--11.13--Nutra
Kim--11.1--Agro Feed
Jeff--11.27--Global Industries
Jimmie--12.4--Daimler-Benz

We also decided that:
1) we'd continue with the SF/East Bay split 
2) each group should combine the answers into one document prior to sending 
to the coordinator for final compilation
3) we'd distribute draft answers to the entire group, since some questions 
feed off of others
4) we'd get finalized responses to the coordinator no later than 4 PM on 
Sunday

Let me know if this tracks with others' memories.

Given that Peace is likely going to try to push legislation to merge the ISO 
and PX and other nasty things, likely makes sense to listen in on our message 
development, tactics in addressing the LMP problem.  You think there'd be any 
problem with that?  If not, could you pass along the call in number?

Thanks,

Thanks, I'll set up a call.

We talked about this in detail with Steve when he was in Houston. Please 
check with him.  The idea is that there would be the flexibility necessary to 
do just about anything.  Also, there are problems with the decision that 
Steve was going to talk with Pulsifer about.  Need to get status of those 
conversations.My understanding was that, if there's a problem with the 
decision, perhaps our filing would be pushed a bit past the Tuesday.  We'll 
need to find that out, too.

Jeremy Meier <jermeier@earthlink.net> on 08/30/2000 11:27:10 AM
J:

Are there additional service offerings (DWDM, etc.) that Enron wants to
offer in California (Steve indicated you guys talked about that) - and if
so, is there a narrative or did Steve get any specific info - for filing
with CPUC per final Decision?

We have to file updated tariffs next Tuesday - and want to include the
latest company service offerings.

Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party.  

Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities.  But 
before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small "d") principles 
call for a wee bit of polling.  

Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses 
pronto.  If we don't receive your responses by COB Thursday, then democracy's 
out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over.  

Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all 
suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight.  Here are the questions:

Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity?

Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear 
from other folks.  If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas 
for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome.  Same 
goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may 
influence where we eat).  Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys.

Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES 
and ENA) or confine it to GA?
Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA?
We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December.  What's your 
preference.  Is there a day that just won't work?

Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on.

Best,
Jeff

Now I understand why you were talking to Rubin and Summers.  Sounds like an 
outstanding hire.  Congratulations.  Exciting changes for exciting times.

Greetings:

Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, 
we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, 
etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes 
of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If 
any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can 
forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled 
a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM 
(PDT).

A Little Background:
Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of 
California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis 
Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a "festooned" arrangement (i.e., exit sea 
at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, 
separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific 
systems.
In addition to "loops" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes 
a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF 
and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial 
leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego 
to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC 
certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from 
Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) 
built and lit by end of Q1 2001.  
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with 
federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey 
altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being "clueless" 
when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in 
(per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

Best,
Jeff

position on what?

Congratulations one and all.  Very exciting, and well deserved to boot.  Look 
forward to working with you in your new roles.  

Best,
Jeff

As a follow-up to our call.  Here is some additional information regarding QF 
pricing issues.

QFs who voluntarily switched to PX pricing have been getting paid full PX 
prices (and there seem to be a couple of thousand MWs that have switched.  
The concern is that the Commission's ultimate decision on PX-based QF prices 
will force the QFs that have switched to "refund" some of the payments 
they've received (e.g., under a "PX minus" mechanism).  The majority of QFs 
are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending before the PUC (except 
those remotely located QFs who will take a big GMM hit).
As we discussed, the Commission strongly rejected Edison's emergency motion 
regarding the gas piece of the QF pricing formula.
Recall also that a couple of months ago 

I accidentally sent it before it was complete.  Full note to follow.

plz call 415.782.7822.  jeff  (how's gracie?)

OK, given the Enron Xmas party in Houston, and Sue's request that weekends be 
included in the ballot, please repond to the dates listed below.  Please give

I always like an activity -- I like to include kids too if that's OK with 
others

I'm fine with including the rest of the office -- that would probably limit 
any activity we would do -- the other business units would have to agree to 
accept any liability to cover last minute back outs (like ENA two years 
ago).  It would also maker the event very BIG -- so I'd be more happy with 
just GA - but I can go either way.

We should include Marcie, Paul, Carl, Roger and Peter and families -- if they 
want to come 

School nights are bad -- even without kids -- so the 7th doesn't work.  We're 
also supposed to be in Houston on the 7th and 8th --so the 8th doesn't work.  
I vote for the following weekend -- fri or Sat

Wednesday, Dec. 13th would work best for me.

FYI.  Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.  
ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that 
would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a 
complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small 
commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service 
for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets 
(upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory 
Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.

Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to 
lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to 
the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity 
offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench" 
services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E 
that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the 
immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).

Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides 
we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Hey Tim:

Calger asked me recently to set up a meeting with Sempra to try to do a gas 
outsource deal.  We're meeting with the CFO and their Chief Reg Officer next 
Thursday.  On a call today, we thought--for a variety of reasons--that we 
ought to throw an electric commodity deal at them, too, while we're there.  
Laird Dyer's going to call you for indicative prices (same drill we did for 
Skilling).  If you have any questions, or want me to fill you in more, just 
give a holler, or check in with Chris.

Jeff

To follow up from yesterdays' call with us, we are going to revise the 
California ETI tariff(s) to parallel your national Enron template.  We are 
also looking at Pacific Bell's Tariff CAL. PUC No. 175T to determine their 
current Dedicated Transport service tariffed rates, and will advise. 
We have a PDF version of the Master Sales Agreement, and are incorporating 
some minor revisions - and maintaining the Contract as governing over the 
tariff.  I believe we also needed input from Enron Broadband Sales on the 
California customer Forms for filing with the updated tariffs. 
If you could pass along the template so we can change the services, that 
would be greatly appreciated.  Please let us know any questions,

Jeff,
Got your voicemail and I think you've got the right idea.  I spoke with the 
lovely Ms. Scott and she and I agreed that: (1) we don't want to endure a 
marathon afternoon (or two) of PG&E preaching the Gospel according to Baja 
Path, and (2) a more compressed 2-hour, mano-y-mano visit with Mr. Cherry to 
discuss Enron's and Transwestern's position in the Gas Accord would be much 
more useful to all parties.  Given the fact that TW has another customer 
meeting next week in Vail, and I've made a tentative commitment to meet with 
a customer in Flagstaff the following week, the only time I can reasonably 
fit in a trip to visit PG&E would be to arrive Wed. night, Nov. 1, and meet 
Thursday a.m., Nov. 2.  (Remember, I'm getting married that Saturday, Nov. 
4th!!!)

If we can't work this schedule out, then, in order to include me, we'll have 
to wait until I get back in mid-November.  If you think TW needs to get the 
face time a little earlier, maybe you and Ms. Scott can meet with him without 
the benefit of me dragging you down. 

Will you get back with us?  Thanks.

Roger.  Mums the word on the gov.

sounds good.  I think we should not talk about the conversations with the

object to the gov talking to us without talking to them at the same time).

Here's the memo on PX-based pricing for QFs that we discussed.  If you have 
any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch.

As a follow-up to our call.  Here is some additional information regarding QF 
pricing issues.

QFs who voluntarily switched to PX pricing have been getting paid full (day 
ahead) PX prices (and there seem to be a couple of thousand MWs that have 
switched).  The concern on the part of the QFs is that the Commission's 
ultimate decision on PX-based QF prices will force the QFs that have switched 
to "refund" some of the payments they've received (e.g., the Commission 
adopts a "PX minus" policy).  
The majority of QFs are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending 
before the PUC.  QFs  in remote locations are not happy with the decision 
since they will take a big GMM hit).
As we discussed, last week the Commission strongly rejected Edison's 
emergency motion regarding the gas price piece of the QF pricing formula.
Recall also that a couple of months ago Edison filed a motion with the 
Commission to alter the "factors" used in the PX pricing formula, as well as 
the gas price indeces.  (See previous note from me and Bruno.)  That 
proceeding continues.  The response to Edison's motion is due this Friday.  
Recently, the judge issued a ruling telling folks not to address the "factor" 
issue (apparently she's heard enough), but to soleley address the gas indeces 
issue.  Edison is likely to re-argue the points that it made previously in 
its emergency motion.
The proceeding is likely to last through the Fall; hard to see a final 
decision coming before year end.
In the meantime, the QFs are angling for a resolution at the Legislature as 
part of a bigger deal to "resolve" the price spike issue in California.
For their part, the QFs want as part of a legilsatively-produced compromise:  
1) maintain SRAC price methodology for 3 years; 2) keep whole those QFs who 
voluntarily switched to PX pricing (i.e., "no PX minus" from the PUC); 3) 
continue to permit, but limit, QF switching from SRAC to PX; and 4) create a 
real retail market in California.
From the QFs perspective, Edison is angling to bifurcate QF pricing, with 
gas-fired QFs getting power prices tied to gas prices, and renewables getting 
prices that are de-linked from gas prices (they'll likely change their minds 
when gas prices fall, however).

That's the latest from this end.  If you've got any questions, don't hesitate 
to call.  415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff

I can help, but what's your timing?

Jim has mentioned a meeting next week with all of us to talk about strategy, 
etc. over the next many months.  Might be a good opportunity to clarify how 
we coordinate on these matters.

	
In general, please contact me before you call on Sarah, Joe and Donna with 
FERC
issues.  I was aware of this filing and have been talking to the traders about
whether we want to do anything about it.  Thanks!

See the email from Donna Fulton below.  Donna joined Government Affairs a 
couple
of months ago.  She was with Enron - GPG for 12 years doing gas regulatory 
work,
so she's an expert in FERC matters but is getting up to speed on electric
matters.  Please feel free to call her in addition to Joe or me on FERC
regulatory matters.

Also, the Cal PX filed at FERC on August 22 its proposal to implement a $350
price cap.  Interventions are due on September 12.  A copy of the filing
(Imaging Format) and FERC's notice are attached.

We should discuss what position we want to take, if any, in response to the 
Cal
PX's filing.

Thanks Jeff-
I really appreciate the talk and your perspective. 
I'm still undecided about school, still need to have
the talk with my contact guy at eLoyalty.  Planning on
that for Friday.  No decisions, lots of open emotional
stuff going on.  I would like to grab lunch or
whatever at some point, but not in the real near
future...I've got to settle my schedule a bit or I'm
going to literally pass out.  My body is reacting to
the abuse quite badly.  Maybe if I get back on the
beach in a week or two!  Anyway-talk to you later and
thanks again-

thanks.  i'll be here.

FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the 
street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the 
"misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney 
thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of 
California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain 
child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also 
set up the Governing Boards.

DJ PG&E Says Won't Try To Escape Rate
                  Freeze For Now >PCG 

                  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

                  SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--PG&E Corp. (PCG) won't try to 
lift California's
                  state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition 
to a deregulated market,
                  saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile 
power prices, senior company
                  officials said Wednesday. 

                       "We aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze. 
But that view might change in
                  the future," said a senior company official, who requested 
anonymity. 

                       PG&E invited reporters to its headquarters Wednesday 
to discuss plans for repairing
                  a "not workably competitive power market" and several steps 
the utility plans to file
                  with federal regulators to do that. 

                       One proposal that is expected to be filed with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory
                  Commission is a return to cost-based rates, where the price 
for power would be
                  predetermined based on generation costs. The company wants 
to temporarily put an
                  end to market-based rates. 

                       The utility will also request that California's 
independent system operator reduce the
                  wholesale power price cap to $100 a megawatt-hour from 
$250/MWh. 

                       Company officials said those steps would allow them to 
recover billions of dollars in
                  unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power 
prices and protect retail
                  customers. 

                       PG&E said generators would still be able to make a 
profit on power sold in California
                  with the reduced cap, and the company doesn't believe the 
state's power supply would
                  be in jeopardy from such an action.

Can/should Bev Hanson get to the bottom of this with Peace?  

My understanding is that the cap is $2500, but that the PX has filed with 
FERC to change it ot $350.  My understanding is that FERC has not acted on 
the request to change it to $350, but I could be wrong.  Dave, Mary, is this 
your understanding?

	Jeannie Mandelker@ECT
	10/13/2000 08:03 AM
		 
Dave Parquet read a story we have for ENA's customer magazine, Exchange, 
about California Power problems.

He says we may have the price cap wrong for the PX.  We have $2,500 for the 
PX and $250 for Cal-ISO.

Are those figures accurate? He says the PX applied to FERC for a $350 cap.

Please advise ASAP as this publication has gone to press and I'm not even 
sure we can change it.

Thanks,
Jeannie

C1 was up 10 points today.  I figure that means you signed a deal with them

I think it would be a good idea to have Ron Carroll in Watkiss' shop to do a 
parallel analysis to what we're going to have Mike Day do.  Ron's very good 
and has done much work on these sortrs of issues.  You comfortable with that?

Thanks, Jeff. We'll see if you're right. If the PX has not actually reduced 
the cap, our story will be fine -- it is really talking about this summer's 
woes.

Jeannie

I think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different 
views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.  But I just 
talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could 
do this absent legislation.  He's going to do the analysis.  Likely better to 
let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, 
we can make that decision at that time.

One last thought:  If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference.  
That way, he and his people are in charge.  But it may be difficult 
(impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout 
to get them to back off.

Steve:
I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that 
Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.  May be 
useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of 
procurement.  Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're 
somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.  I'm also going to give you 
the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for 
prices at SP15.

responsibilities of CLCs and NDIECs in California.  Also attached are the
referenced California code sections and those Commission decisions for which
we have an electronic version.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Please note that Jeff does not have access to his email, so he has asked
that one of you forward this message to Lara Leibman.

Thank you

Here are the very indicative prices Tim gave us for 5 year deals at SP15.  
They'll likely  change by the time we meet with Sempra on Thursday.

25 MW, on peak (6X16):  $53/MWh
25 MW, base load (7X24):  $45/MWh
500 MW, on peak (6X16):  $55/MWh
500 MW, base load (7X24):  $47/MWh

My pleasure.

Beautiful.  Tuesday it is.  Have a great weekend.

Kupiecki sent me an e-mail this morning about getting together for our
project soon.  How does Tuesday at break sound?

Sounds good to me!

Do you want to try to read the case on our own and meet during the break on
Tuesday to discuss?

Let me know what you think!

Hi Kelly,

What do you think about the idea of getting our group together to talk 
about the finance project soon?  If we wait too long, it will sneak up on
us.

Jeff:

As a reminder, note that the Quarterly Fee Reporting Statement you
received and  forwarded to us and Enron Accounting technically needs to
be submitted to the CPUC/State by October 15, 2000.  If it is indeed all
Zero's for amounts billed, then you should still fill in zero's and send
it to Sacramento sometime before Nov. 15, 2000 (penalty would attach as
of 11/15).

Wood, the Assigned Commissioner in the investigation of wholesale electric 
markets, has asked for comments on the following questions by Friday, 
September 8.  We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of 
ARM and WPTF.  

This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the 
record.  The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be 
helpful in answering these questions.  I will take a first cut at drafting 
response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week.  We can take liberties in 
providing responses that go beyond the question asked.

Market Structure:

Are the market conditions currently being experienced (price spikes and suppy 
shortages) inevitable under the current market structure?
Do generators and/or scheduling coordinators have market power?
Is there a need to mitigate such market power?
Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability 
planning?
Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure 
reasonable prices and reliable service?
Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the 
goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service?

Market Rules:

Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes?
What roles, if any, do underscheduling in forward markets, out of state 
transfers, uniform PX auction prices and ISO real-time and out-of-market 
purchases play in the outcomes being experienced?

Behavior of Market Participants:

What is working and not working in terms of price, reliability, information 
exchange, resource distribution, equity, service quality, and types of 
planned generation?

That's actually where it came from.  I pulled it from the articles being sent 
around.  This one was important enough that I wanted to get folks' 
attention.  have a great weekend.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

I will not be in the office tomorrow - off to  Sacramento to see NCPA - but I 
wanted to provide my comments regarding the  Sempra presentation.? First of 
all, you did a great job.??I don't  know about "Partnership Solutions"; 
however, I can't think of a better  description of what we want so, let's 
make it work.
?
Here are my comments:
?
1.? On the page, "Partnership Goals", under  2nd bullet.
?
??? Change "Enhance earnings" to  "Enhance earnings; Expand P/E Multiple"
?
2.? On the page, "Energy Solutions", remove  both 25 MW quotes.? They don't 
have much meaning to Sempra; therefore, I  suggest we go with the two 500 MW 
quotes only.
?
3.? On the page, "Energy Solutions", under the  2nd bullet.
?
??? Change "Sempra gets better...."  to 
?
??? "Enhanced access to  markets"
??? "Open, liquid and  competitive"
??? "Defensible to oversight  entities"
?
4.? On the page, "Benefits of Online  Independent Auction", the 3rd and 4th 
bullets?are not?benefits of the  auction.? They are benefits of?a fixed price 
product. Do we need a  bullet to suggest that Sempra needs a portfolio 
approach which includes some  fixed priced products?
?
5.? On the page, "Enron Can Help", under the  4th bullet, change Lot 
formulation to Product Specifications.? After  Pre-Qualification:? 
Experience,?Capability, Credit-worthiness,  Reliability
?
6.? On the page, "Gas Solution, Procurement  Outsourcing 1", under the 1st 
bullet, indicate multi-year instead of 10  year.
?
7.? On the page, "Gas Solution, Procurement  Outsourcing 2", in the 2nd 
bullet, pluralize service to services.
?
8.? On the page, "Benefits of Procurement  Outsourcing", under the 1st bullet 
in the 3rd point (responsive to financial  community) - Add to the existing 
statement, Reduce?regulatory risk tied to  procurement, "Enhance Earnings, 
Expand P/E Multiple".
?
Thanks for your efforts in developing this.?  I'll be in late Monday and 
Tuesday morning.
?
Laird

Will do. Thanks.

Good morning professor:
Unfortunately, I'm traveling on business today (it's raing in Vancouver) and 
can't attend class tonite.  I was wondering if you'd be distributing the take 
home midterm in this evening's class.  Also, could you resend the access code 
for the Craftmade case?  I believe that I copied it down incorrectly.  Thank 
you very much.

Best,
Jeff

OK, lots of folks are interested.  Given that section is on Saturday, I 
propose 10 AM, this Sunday, at my office (101 California, Suite 1950).  If 
folks have a real problem with that, let me know.  Also, please RSVP so that 
I can arrange things with building security.

Greetings:

Well, there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed 
getting together the weekend before for a study session.  

I just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if I've included folks 
who ain't even in finance, or if I've left some folks off.  Sorry to those 
who received in error, and please forward to anyone else who might be 
interested.  Anyway, anyone interested?  

Hope all is well with all.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks for the dinners, and the breakfast, and the company.  It was fun.  And 
don't get cranky, but I'm going to be in and out of things this weekend since 
I have midterms Monday and Tuesday.  Likely means that I'll be studying in 
Berkeley and SF during the days on Sat and Sun but will be present for the 
evenings.  H0pe that works.

Kisses,
Jeff

Hi,
Just a reminder that those of you who have not yet handed me a group list 
for the project, need to do so soon, as the deadline is approaching.

In case word hasn't gotten around, ENA learned COB Friday, that it has been 
chosen to engage in further negotiations with the ISO for about 450 MWs of 
projects.  The preliminary award is based on ENA's response to the RFQ that 
the ISO issued last month for "emergency resources."

Howdy:

Just between thee and me, I think this note gets to some of the challenges we 
faced and discussed as part of our "group gropes" over the last several 
months.  With Sue coming back on Tuesday, and in the spirt of our gropes, it 
might be useful to discuss as a group prior to charging ahead.  May even 
result in the same outcome on how to proceed, but a little "process" on the 
front end may go a long way toward keeping things on an even keel.  Anywho, 
just my two cents.  Hope your meetings in Salem went well.

Best,
Jeff

ENA also sold 100 MW of peak power (6x16) to PG&E for 5 years beginning in 
January of 2001 delivered in NP15.  They declined our offer for flat (7x24) 
power delivered in NP15 of $50.90/MWh.  The trade press is claiming that they 
purchased 400 MW from Calpine delivered in the new Greater Bay Area zone for 
around $51/MWh.  I believe that these values are lower than the current 
generation component of PG&E's frozen rates.

PG&E procured these MW's through a traditional rfp.  This is a pretty clean 
bilateral deal done outside of the PX.  We papered the deal using the EEI 
master agreement.

Sure makes sense.  One concern.  If they buy up to 80% of load, do we run the 
risk of "stranded cost" problem later down the road when we hit the 
backwardated part of the curve.  Hinges on the term of the contract.  Sort of 
chicken and egg problem.  If the buy for short terms, the prices will be 
high, if they buy for longer terms, the prices will be lower, but the risk of 
stranded cost rises.  Thoughts?

	Margaret Carson
	10/18/2000 08:33 AM
		 
Jeff   Is  there   merit  in  California's  regulators     requiring  that  
utilities first  buy up blocks
of firm  power   to meet,  say, 80 percent of their load  before  they are  
allowed a
price  cap (be  it   $100  or whatever)    on the  rest.  It certainly  makes 
lously  economic  sense
to  price    cap ALL of it..    Even  pro-utility commissioners  can  see 
through  that kind of  bail out  strategy  ..
your comments appreciated ...   Margaret...

Thanks.  do i need to do anything with the form?

FYI.
	
Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at the
power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale market 
in
the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) 
and I
created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and
Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made the following 
points:
   There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not 
in
   the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that 
would
   hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the 
West
   as well.
   High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does
   anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised
   by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still
   incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level
   equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.
   The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by
   scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load,
   therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time
   prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund
   as an asset allocation scheme.
   The market would function better if more information was provided to the
   market.
   The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you
will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is
looking into the data we provided.

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and
answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of
scarcity .

review on Sunday from 10 am to noon at my office.  you're welcome to come.

Well, you don't have voice mail yet I see.  Could you give me a call when you

Seabron has agreed to write a brief sumary of the Section 206 white paper, in 
layman's terms, to be used in our communications with the press. 

Knew you'd be dying to know that Barry Staw will be teaching a class on 
"Creativity" in the Spring.  Be sure to reserve your place today!

Best,
Jeff

I just figured it was a way for you to finally track him down---you know, 
show up at his class and get midevil on his ass for a few minutes....

That is a great solution!  You mean work part time, or go to school part 
time.  Very selfishly, I'm of course very glad that you're staying in the 
evening program.  We're actually getting together on Sunday (I hope I didn't 
mess things up).  Yes, it's for finance, though you're welcome to join---we 
can use all the help that we can get.

I'm really glad to hear that things are going better.  You seemed in pretty 
good spirits on Tuesday, though I guess that could have partially been due to 
the big celebration over getting your first ticket.  Congratulations!  I'll 
buy you a beer.  I have a feeling that the only reason you haven't gotten one 
until now is because you've managed to talk your way out of many.

Best,
Jeff

It was a little dramatic when I saw that Tuesday
night.  I feel a bit overwhelmed that he's back.  The
quality, the learnings!  What to do?  If only I can
find a way to get in the class.  Jeez!  Seriously
though-you like the offering? Thanks for checking in
on Tuesday.  Things are better...less overwhelmed by
decisions and such.  Staying part-time (decision as of
Monday).  Expect to spend more time in SF with the job
after next week.  Want to keep my options open and
feel I can do that better hanging out in the evening
program.  Jackie mentioned that you are all grouping
on Sat to study..is this for finance?  Talk to you
soon-
Courtney

FYI.  I didn't receive email yesterday, and I only started receiving them 
today at 11 AM.  Quesiton:  After Clinton's speech, don't you think the 
convention is going to cry when they have to sit through Al Gore?  I'm 
worried----he's so pathetic.

I thought was pretty awesome!? My favorite was his Harry Truman quote that I 
had never heard before:? "If you want to live like a Republican, you better 
vote like a Democrat."? Scotty - maybe that's a line you can use!

Joke: 
Memory Clinic 
Two elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when 
one of the men asked the other, "Fred, how was the memory 
clinic you went to last month?" 

"Outstanding," Fred replied. "They taught us all the latest 
psychological techniques: visualization, association, etc. 
It was great." 

"That's great! And what was the name of the clinic?" 

Fred went blank. He thought and thought, but couldn't 
remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, 
"What do you call that flower with the long stem and 
thorns?" 

"You mean a rose?" 

"Yes, that's it!" 

He turned to his wife, "Rose, what was the name of that 
memory clinic?"

Wow, lots of fun out there, eh?  Don't know what it will be like without

I have a very mundane question, though.  What prices for intrastate capacity 
did the PUC finally come up with in the Sempra BCAP for large generators 
under the new "Sempra-wide" rate doctrine?  Thanks a million.

First apologies if you're getting this and you ain't even in finance---it's a 
study list from last year.  If it's annoying the heck out of you.  Write back 
and I'll try to modify the list.  Second, please forward to those you know 
I've missed.  

Just to clarify.  Meet at my office on Sunday from 10 am to Noon.  Please 
bring specific questions.  We'll go round the room and let folks ask 
questions and the group will attempt to answer them.

Well, there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed 
getting together the weekend before for a study session.  

I just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if I've included folks

who received in error, and please forward to anyone else who might be 
interested.  Anyway, anyone interested?

Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made 
at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week?

I have the distinct impression that you're glad this has been finalized....

'Thanks a million.  Agree that humor is needed right now, though it's in 
short supply, so to speak....

Thanks.  Remind me to tell you the story of the time that I was on a panel 
with him. Yours is the most succint description of him that I've heard to 
date.  Was curious whether his rant was getting any traction with people that 
matter.  Sounds like it isn't.  

	Tim Belden@ECT
	10/19/2000 05:36 PM
		
I don't know if you know the history behind McCullough.  He is a consultant 
who primarily advises industrial loads.  He advised his customers that prices 
were going down and that they should go on index based tariffs rather than 
fixed-price tariffs.  Needless to say, his advise cost his customers a great 
deal of money.  Notable examples are Bellingham Cold Storage and Georgia 
Pacific in Puget Sound Energy's service territory.  Rather than acknowledge 
that he was wrong, Robert is on a witch hunt.  His data is bad, his analysis 
is horrible, he lies with numbers but does a good job being pompous and 
putting together flashy power point presentations.  I have not heard of 
anybody agreeing with him, including the NWPPC, CEC, CAISO, CAPX.  He is a 
loud entertaining speaker, so I am sure that he will continue to get coverage.

Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made 
at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week?

yes.  be happy to talk tomorrow.  just give a holler when you've a minute.   
thanks.

Hey Jeff,

I signed you up as my roommate for the mid term retreat. I hadn't set
anything up with anyone else and when I went to the EMBA office to see
who was still open I noticed that you hadn't either. If in the mean
time, you have set something up with someone else, don't sweat it. They
said they could change it. I hope you haven't though because I think it
would be fun.

See you Sunday.

Thanks, Mark.  Sounds good.  As it turns out, there is a very slight chance 
that I might be on the panel in California with Prof. Littlechild.  I'll take 
you/him up on the offer to get together while he's here. 

Best,
Jeff

	Mark Schroeder@ECT

Professor Littlechild has written a peper on the importance of retial markets 
(being open) to the development of a well-functioning liberalised/deregulated 
energy market, i.e., wholesale markets alone to suffice.  As it turns out, 
Paul Dawson and Chris Day of my team here in London have reviewed and 
commented on earlier drafts of this paper.  We have paid for none of his 
research, and there will be no explicit recognition of Enron support for the 
work.  However, Littlechild, as Jeff already knows, has been asked to present 
his paper to a seminar/conference in California, and to a Tokyo research 
institute.  Much of his travel is paid for, but he was not being compensated 
for his time in making these trips.  Given that his message is one we want to 
get out into the marketplace of ideas, I have agreed to pay him for one day 
of his usual professional rate/fees, each, for San Francisco and Tokyo.  In 
turn, he has offered to come into our offices (your offices) to meet with 
you, discuss his research, and to learn more about your business and your 
issues.  May i suggest that if you are interested, and I think this is a 
worthwhile way to exchange ideas/views, that you just contact him directly, 
referencing that you work with me and I passed along his offer.  I will be 
sending to each of you a copy of a monograph I have on the paper (I am not 
sure if it is the full piece of work) for your information and future 
reference.  Nick - after meeting him, you might inquire as to whether you can 
publish his paper on your Japan web-site.  thanks and let me know if you need 
any more information.   mcs   

Dear Mark

Sorry to keep pressing you, but I am not sure whether you received this
message and whether the proposed support is acceptable to you.  I received
only your subsequent comment that VAT is no problem.  I need to give an
answer to Berkeley and Tokyo before I leave in a few hours time.
Regards
Stephen

Thanks so much for the gifts.  Very sweet.  Sorry I was rushed, but I've got

But I really want to hear more about the trip.  Sounds like it was a blast.  

You looked lovely in the pictures, all dressed up a la l'Italienne, and you

Article noting that FERC will have special meeting on Nov 1 re California 
markets, also Article that Terry Winter is having a press conference today 
(Friday) about how the market will be fixed: 
FERC To Meet Nov 9 To Propose Remedies To Calif 
                    Pwr Mkt 
                    Friday, October 20, 2000 08:17 AM 
  
                    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--In an unusual move, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory                     Commission said Thursday it will meet 
Nov. 1 to discuss remedies to California's                     troubled 
wholesale power market. 
                    Details of a probe into California's wholesale 
electricity market will also be released at                     the Nov. 1 
meeting. As reported, state and federal regulators launched the probe over    
                 the summer, saying the market wasn't workably competitive. 
                    FERC also said it expects to hold a public hearing Nov. 9 
to discuss possible                     solutions to California's power 
crisis. 
                    The place and time of both meetings haven't been decided 
yet. 
                    Regarding Thursday's announcement, FERC Commissioner Curt 
Hebert said "rather                     than waiting for Nov. 1 to release 
the findings of our staff's investigation, I urge the                     
chairman to release the completed report now...it can only help heal the raw 
emotions                     rampant in the state of California." 
                    FERC said it was rare that it would announce details of 
its procedures. The                     commission said its own rules don't 
allow it to normally announce its procedures. 
                    "Because of the need for expeditious action to address 
the serious issues affecting                     California electric power 
markets and California consumers...the commission is taking                   
  the unusual step of announcing in advance the procedures it expects to 
follow over the                     coming weeks to move forward in these 
proceedings," the FERC order said. 
                    The commission said it will give a three-week deadline 
for parties to intervene and to                     comment on the possible 
solutions presented by the commission. 
                    FERC said it anticipates issuing an order by the end of 
the year "adopting and                     directing remedies to promptly 
address to the extent possible the identified problems                     
adversely affecting competitive power markets in California." 
                    If necessary, FERC said it would hold additional meetings 
to develop solutions "to                     other identified problems." 
                    California's wholesale power prices soared this past 
summer. Customers of San                     Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit 
of Sempra Energy Corp. (SRE, news, msgs), paid                     
market-based rates for power, which resulted in triple-digit utility bills 
for its customers.                     The state's three investor-owned 
utilities also racked up billions of dollars in debt due                     
to high wholesale costs. 
                    SDG&E customers are currently paying a fixed rate for 
their power, while customers of                     the state's other two 
utilities are still bound by a rate-freeze. 
                    Generators have been accused of gouging customers and 
manipulating the market,                     although no evidence has been 
offered up yet. However, the FERC investigation may                     
address that.

Cal-ISO CEO To Announce Remedy To Lower Power 
                    Cost 
                    Friday, October 20, 2000 08:16 AM 
                    (This article was originally published Thursday) 
                    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Independent System 
Operator Chairman and                     Chief Executive Terry Winter will 
hold a news conference Friday morning to announce                     a 
possible solution to reduce the state's electricity costs. 
                    An ISO spokesman wouldn't comment on the details of the 
news conference. 
                    According to a news release, Winter will speak about 
"potential vehicles for containing                     costs, while 
maintaining the ISO's high standards of reliability." 
                    The ISO controls about 75% of California's power grid and 
real-time market. As                     already reported, the grid operator

did i, or did i not, already give you mine.  signed, confused.

plz call at 415.782.7822.

Good idea.  Unfortunately, I'll be sitting in an office in S.D. with Sempra 
execs.  My apologies.  But since this is likely to be ongoing, preference 
would be to participate in the "first" meeting.

Jeff,

Could you possibly call in? We could arrange for a dial-in number in that 
case.  I know that we arranged that date with tax bc/Sue is coming in that 
day and they had cleared that date with some of the accounting or legal folks 
already.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that 
didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.  The description of 
the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on 
sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in.

$100 cap for "old" generation; "new" generation would be exempt.
FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of 
their power.
For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100 
cap, and the $250 cap will apply.
Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled 
gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward 
market.
Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market 
will be penalized (details to be "ironed" out).

The ISO is supposed to make the filing at FERC today.

Hopefully, the next meeting will work better for your schedule and we will

OK, given the Enron Xmas party in Houston, and Sue's request that weekends be 
included in the ballot, please repond to the dates listed below.  Please give 
1) your top 3 preferences, and 2) any days for which you have a (true) 
conflict.  Thanks.  Also, unless I hear otherwise, we'll assume that partners 
and children come included.  Thanks.

Nov. 30, Dec. 1, Dec. 2
Dec. 14th, 15th, 16th

I always like an activity -- I like to include kids too if that's OK with 
others

I'm fine with including the rest of the office -- that would probably limit 
any activity we would do -- the other business units would have to agree to 
accept any liability to cover last minute back outs (like ENA two years 
ago).  It would also maker the event very BIG -- so I'd be more happy with 
just GA - but I can go either way.

We should include Marcie, Paul, Carl, Roger and Peter and families -- if they 
want to come 

School nights are bad -- even without kids -- so the 7th doesn't work.  We're 
also supposed to be in Houston on the 7th and 8th --so the 8th doesn't work.  
I vote for the following weekend -- fri or Sat
Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party.  

Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities.  But 
before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small "d") principles 
call for a wee bit of polling.  

Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses 
pronto.  If we don't receive your responses by COB Thursday, then democracy's 
out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over.  

Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all 
suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight.  Here are the questions:

Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity?

Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear 
from other folks.  If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas 
for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome.  Same 
goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may 
influence where we eat).  Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys.

Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES 
and ENA) or confine it to GA?
Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA?
We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December.  What's your 
preference.  Is there a day that just won't work?

Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on.

Best,
Jeff

Jim:  To say that there was gaming in the UK pool is a significant 
understatement.  Couple thoughts...I'm pretty sure that Seab has done 
extensive analysis on the UK and he'd likely therefore be very useful in 
developing rebuttal. (Though very close to it at one point, I've been removed 
for a few years.)  Also, Schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some 
insights, and seems that Schroeder's pretty close now with Littlechild---that 
might be another avenue for information to rebut.

Hi Lee:

Looks great.  Could you do me a favor?  You have "generating company" rep on 
the agenda.  Enron does not see itself as a generating company.  In fact, the 
only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in 
Southern California.  Could you change it to "energy service provider" rep?  
Hope that's not a problem.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings All:
If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday.  Steve Bowen & 
Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of 
weeks ago in Houston.  Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review.  
Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow.  Thoughts?

P.S.  Some good news.  Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I 
mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona 
(in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN.  Well, I've 
spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time 
ago, so that's one less thing to worry about.

DELETE IF NOT A BART SHUTTLE RIDER.

A BART shuttle rider recently suggested that the shuttle leave 5 minutes
earlier (9:35 pm rather than 9:40 pm) to accommodate the BART schedule.
Apparently, the extra five minutes gets students to the station just
shortly after BART leaves, causing students to wait until the next train
20 minutes later.

If you a BART shuttle rider, please provide me some feedback.

Cal-ISO Wants Pwr Generators To Forward Bid 70% -Sources
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator is
expected to file a petition with federal regulators Friday seeking authority
to force generators to bid 70% of their supply into the forward market in an
effort to reduce wholesale power costs in the state, according to a source
familiar with the issue.

     An official with the state's Electricity Oversight Board confirmed the
details of the filing.

     The filing calls for FERC to set a "just and reasonable" rate for a
large fraction of suppliers' capacity, while remaining supply would be able
to earn market-based rates, according to the source.

     In addition, major out-of-state generators would have to enter into
forward contracts at FERC mandated rates for "a significant portion of their
expected sales."

     ISO Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Winter will hold a news
conference Friday morning that will focus on possible solutions to lower
wholesale energy costs. He is expected to announce how bidding into the
forward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs.

     The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar
filing with federal regulators in the near future, sources said.

     In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a
measure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a
majority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of
market power, the ISO has said in prior meetings.

     Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators
can influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power
occurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of
generation ownership "allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high
demand periods."

     About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in
the spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO.

     In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to
enter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the
daily market price fluctuations.

     Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a "key
source of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000," according to an ISO
report.

     The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid
operator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required
to approve such an action.

     EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action

     The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to
Gary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board.
Heath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news
conference.

     "We're trying to find out what's behind this," Heath told Dow Jones
Newswires. "We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It
came as a surprise."

     Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to
eclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month.

     FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market
this past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably
competitive and participants manipulate the market. Energy officials have
blamed the ISO for this summer's power woes.

We'll send a card.  She's 19?  Well, if we have to, we'll take some 
tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too.  

Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road while 
my is doing my road at the end of the month?   He's going to fax me the 
estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.  To be honest, 
the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this guy is 
really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.  He's pretty 
willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to Rolls 
Royce-style road.  And if you want to take a pass, that's of course great, 
too.  I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a 
cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know.

I don't know if Prentice will get the e-mail, Jeff - so could you try to help 
make sure this happens.? Sunday is Amber's birthday.? Since we will be at the 
Cubs game it would be great if you guys could send her a card.

When you come to get your stuff, take all the tomatoes you want with you!? 
Are you going to take Annie?

Steve:  

Attached is a memo that reponds to your question:  "Can the solution to the 
utilities' undecollection problem take place at the PUC, or is a legislative 
fix required?"  As we discussed, I'm also attaching a memo from Mike Day on 
the issue.  

Bottom line:  It's within the PUC's jurisdiction to solve the problem, but 
the likelihood is high that it will be a key focus of the Legislature in the 
next session.  If you, or anyone on the distribution, have any questions, let 
me know.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks for you help, Simon.  And Margaret, as always, thank you very much.

Got a call that Loretta Lynch and Rod Wright, among others, spoke at 
yesterday's annual meeting of regulation lawyers.  The following was very 
briefly relayed to me:  

President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not 
facts; 2) she wants to completely re-organize the PUC, top to bottom (in her 
image?  Amen); 3) she frowns on lobbying---if you "come knocking on her door, 
that's a strike against you."  One should participate, along with the rest of 
the public, through the hearing process.

Rod Wright said that businesses (including Enron) are being frustrated by 
rules and regs that act as unnecessary impediments.

Actually ordering El Paso to do what TW already does, so if anything, affirms 
TW's operating procedures.  El Paso has been in the cross-hairs of the entire 
industry.  Interestingly, this suit arose from the lengthy and detailed 
discussions we all had as part of the settlement---as you can imagine, El 
Paso saw it as a negative outcome of those talks.  We can discuss further 
when I'm in Houston tomorrow and Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Chairman Hoecker announced that FERC will hold a special meeting Nov. 1 to 
issue a proposed order detailing possible remedies to the California 
wholesale market based on two investigations currently underway.

Only one item was discussed - an order resolving the Amoco complaint over El 
Paso's capacity allocation.  In the order, the Commission finds that El 
Paso's allocation of delivery point capacity at Topock is unjust & 
unreasonable.  The Commission directs El Paso to assign primary point rights 
to its shippers using a one-time assignment process outlined in the order.  
If elections for primary point capacity exceed available space, El Paso will 
pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an 
iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their 
firm capacity rights.  Chairman Hoecker said this case illustrates the fact 
that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the 
overbooking of airline capacity.

FYI:  Got a call from a colleague who told me that Loretta Lynch and Rod 
Wright, among others, spoke at yesterday's annual meeting of regulation 
lawyers.  The following sums up what was very briefly relayed to me about 
Pres. Lynch's and Rod Wright's remarks:  

President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not

that's a strike against you.  One should participate, along with the rest of 
the public, through the hearing process."

Rod Wright sounded a more positive tone, stating that businesses (including 
Enron) are being frustrated by rules and regs that act as unnecessary 
impediments to plant development.  He made the point that the rules and regs 
need to be made more rationale and streamlined.  Apparently, he's still 
clinging to the idea of the State getting in to the power plant development 
business by signing contracts with providers.

our original contract language was to capture all of the post-transition=20

Attached is a version of AB1890.  I refer you to pages 31 through 36 which=
=20
discusses Sections 367 through 368.

Residual CTCs may have two connotations.  The first connotation is the type=
=20
of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period.  For example, the California=
=20
IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates.  From those frozen rates, delive=
ry=20
and procurement costs are subtracted.  What is left over residually is the=
=20
recovery of CTCs.  The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs=
=20
that are recovered after the frozen rate period.  Due to these two possible=
=20
interpretations, I believe that either the term "residual CTCs" needs to be=
=20
defined or a better definition of the "Pre-Rolloff Period" and "Post-Rollof=
f=20
Period."

After reading the cites that I referred to above, if you believe the=20
definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections 367 and=
=20
368, then I will be comfortable with the current language.  My concern was=
=20
that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section 368 that=
=20
would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers, and only benefit and protect=20
Standard Offer customers.  Pursuant to Section 368, the IOUs implemented co=
st=20
recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section 367.  I a=
m=20
worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in =
a=20
the Post-Rolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plan=
s=20
(i.e. SDG&E's rate cap).

You can contact Susan Mara, Jeff Dasovich, or Mona Petrochko in Government=

Affairs for better clarification if needed.

Tim,

Thanks for forwarding me the contract.  In Section 3(a), there is a=20
definition for "Post-Rolloff Period" which states, "shall mean, with respec=
t=20
to each Facility, the period of time commencing with the day after the last=
=20
day of the Pre-Rolloff Period.....but not including any extension period=20
pursuant to Section 3(g)(ii).  The problem is that I cannot find Section=20
3(g)(i) in the contract.

Further, the definition of "Pre-Rolloff Period" which states, "...ending on=
=20
the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs (but=
=20
excluding residual CTCs) in its service territory under AB1890," is=20
ambiguous.  There are two possible solutions.  One possible solution is to=

You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period=

period ends earlier than priced, then our mark for this deal should increas=
e=20
because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a=20
shorter period than expected.  Conversely, if the rate freeze ends later th=
an=20
how we priced it, then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will=
=20
have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than =
we=20
had priced.  This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil=
e=20
of our California portfolio.

My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is=20
defined.  It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose=
=20
ends.  Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of=
=20
the transition period, which is a critical date because the delivery risks=
=20
hinge on that definition.  I just want to do some preventative maintenance,=
=20
such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future. =
=20
However, we may proceed signing this contract if necessary.  I would just=

like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this=
=20
deal.  As a matter of fact, I would not even try to change the contract=20
language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern.

I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now.

The attached draft answers the California Municipal Utilities Association 
complaint that California markets are not workably competitive and therefore 
FERC should establish cost-based rates.  In its complaint, CMUA argued that 
the market isn't workably competitive because the prices were higher this 
summer than in previous years even in hours where demand was no higher.  
Seabron's paper shows that high prices have resulted from a number of 
unrelated structural and market design factors and increasing attempts at 
regulatory intervention.  Our answer is due at FERC tomorrow so please get me 
your comments ASAP.

Mary:

Please find attached a first draft of Enron's response to the CMUA, please
let us know your comments.

Seabron can be contacted on his cell-phone (617 513 5904) this morning, but
will be in the office at noon. Alternatively, you could pass on comments to
me.

Are you or is one of our staff able to assist us with a reference to the
claim that hydro water levels were low in California this year?

Best wishes,

Sabine.

Anywho, would have been fun.  Sorry I'm already booked.  Had the midterm last

Jim Steffes suggested that we develop message points in anticipation of 
FERC's ruling on November 1.  

In this regard, we could:  (1) use the Seabron Adamson paper as our central 
message; and (2)develop separate messages for a variety of FERC 
outcomes--e.g., cost-based rates or additional rate caps.  

To that end, we are scheduling a conference call at 11:00 A.M. (PST) this 
Friday, October 27.  

Lysa:  please contact folks on the above-list to see if they are available.  
Assuming we can reach critical mass for the call, forward AT&T conference 
calling information to the above-list.  

So it is the 2nd after all?  Thought it might be the first, which I could 
have made.  The 2nd doesn't work---have set up a meeting with ENA to meet 
with Sempra execs to see if a deal can be done (yeah, right).  But since it's 
that early on the 2nd, I can call in by conference call and attend the first 
90 minutes, or so.  Will that work?

In other exciting news, going to meet with the lawyers and Bowen either this 
afternoon or first thing in the morning tomorrow.  You want to join?  And 
should I see if Scott and/or Donald want to attend?  Just let me know.

ELECTRICITY SUMMIT AT U.C. BERKELEY, NOVEMBER 13, 2000

U.C. Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy, with additional support
from the U.C. Berkeley's Competition Policy Center and the U.C. Energy
Institute, will host a meeting of industry representatives, policy makers,
consumers representatives, legislators and researchers to discuss the

I'm going to be out of the office from about 3:00 this afternoon until 11:00

would like to join by phone.   (But don't worry about scheduling around me if 
it's a problem).  Donald is on his way back from South America, and probably 
isn't available.  Scott may be available by phone and probably would be

Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a 
CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.  Have distributed to Western GA 
team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.  

Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."  Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta 
Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to 
deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the 
solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.  

The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.  

Comments are much appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

for the offer we made to S.D. last week.  You had mentioned that you might 
want to include a shaped product.  You still considering it?  Let us know and 
we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.

My flight gets into S.D. at at 8:35 on southwest.

Best,

DJ US Richardson To Unveil Calif Pwr Supply Initiatives Wed 
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will announce 
Wednesday a series of initiatives the Clinton administration will undertake 
to help alleviate California's power supply crisis, the U.S. Department Of 
Energy said in a press release Tuesday. 
     
Richardson will announce the initiatives at a press event in Sacramento. He 
will be joined by California Gov. Gray Davis and California congressional and 
state lawmakers. 

     The initiatives will "help California reduce the strain on its 
electricity system and increase electric grid reliability," the DOE said in 
the release. 

     The event is scheduled for 11 a.m. PST (1900 GMT) at the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District's Hedge Photovoltaic Facility. 

     A DOE spokesman declined to provide further information Tuesday.

Here are the messages as I understand them.  Please let me know if I've 
misconstrued anything.  Thanks.

FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to 
manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a 
fundamental step in the right direction.
However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility 
in California.  As structured, it will:
discourage the development of new generation to serve California
fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that 
FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap 
proposal.
We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and 
quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers.

I agree with much of what Jeff has written.  Here are some additions -

On FERC getting a lot right, look at the Order in relation to our 4 key 
points filed in the White Paper -
Removing Market Transparency - Still need FERC to take action
Development of Forwards Market and Risk Management - Great results
Removing distortions on Prices - Wrong action
Ending Cal ISO / Cal PX Stakeholder Boards - Great results

On the risk management issue, FERC itself said "The single most important 
remedy that California market needs is the elimination of rules that prevent 
market participants from managing risk". [FERC PRESS RELEASE]

ADD - FERC Staff did a great job on preparing a detailed analysis of the 
market issues.

Looks good, except for the comments on "discourages generation".  Make it 
"discourages peaking generation".  

Although I agree that any price cap has a "discouraging " impact on the 
generation market, it is a matter of degree in this sound bite environment.  
To the point, without a creative exit strategy, I would not waste development 
money on a 10000-13000 BTU/KWh heat rate peaking project.  However, even with 
the FERC order, I will continue to spend money developing base load, 7000 
BTU/KWh heat rate projects.  The state is tremendously short on power, the 
price cap goes away (theoretically) in two years, $150 is well above the 
average expected price in our forcast models (although I agree not above the 
price for particular hours if scalers are applied.)

I think we should shy away from the 300 MW message.  It's getting in the way 
of the positive message, and the math turns out to be a bit "Goreish."  
(read: fuzzy)  I found myself wandering down all sorts of blind alleys in my 
spin to Dow Jones.  I say we generalize it more.  Something to the effect of 
"The price caps send the wrong message to the marketplace.  Whether it's gas 
lines in the seventies or bread lines in the old Soviet Union, price caps and 
market intervention cause problems."

That's fine if you don't want to do the road, but please tell Eldon and I'll 
tell Jeff (my road guy).

Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> on 08/31/2000 10:08:52 AM
We really cannot do the road at this point. 

Amber's address:? 25664 Carmel Knolls Road, Carmel, CA 93923.? She is 20 
years old on Sunday!. 

I wrote you because I am not sure if Prentice is getting e-mails. 

Remember that some of your stuff might still be outside if I don't remember 
to bring it in.? There is also a folder of pick sheets to take up to the dome 
and leave on my desk, so we have them when any of us are up there.

We'll send a card.? She's 19?? Well, if we have to, we'll take some 
tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too. 

Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road 
while my is doing my road at the end of the month??? He's going to fax me 
the estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.? To be 
honest, the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this 
guy is really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.? He's 
pretty willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to 
Rolls Royce-style road.? And if you want to take a pass, that's of course 
great, too.? I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a 
cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know. 

Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> on 08/31/2000 09:53:11 AM 

I don't know if Prentice will get the e-mail, Jeff - so could you try to 
help make sure this happens.? Sunday is Amber's birthday.? Since we will be 
at the Cubs game it would be great if you guys could send her a card. 

When you come to get your stuff, take all the tomatoes you want with you! 
Are you going to take Annie?

My bet is that Pat will be at NARUC.  I think that Michael Moore, PhD 
Economist and CEC commissioner would be very good (I tried Bilas--he's got a 
conflict) and don't think it's a problem that he and Larson are both on 
because they'll come with two quite different takes.  

P.S. FERC dropped a bomb on California today.

Apologies.  I'm in S.D. with Calger and Dyer to meet w/Sempra tomorrow

Folks  -- Attached is a summary of the Commission's Order on California.  
Constitutional Crisis here we come.  Later JOE

Just got back from Sacramento.  Davis still pandering...

Nope, not at this point.  Rather than start with money, we'd rather start 
with getting the rules (i.e., the IOUs) fixed so that there ain't regulatoy 
roadblock after roadblock standing in the way of deployment.  Sound 
reasonable?

so I see ENRON remains in support of PPP extension; what about using these 
funds to help buy down the costs (to consumers) of micropower technologies, 
such as customer-side of the meter fuel cells and microturbines?

Don:? See attached from today's WSJ. 

(See attached file: Efficiency bill running into opposition from 
governor.doc) 

thanks.  let's discuss further.

Jeff - Thanks for hosting the meeting.  PG& still needs to decide what it
really wants out of the gas accord, but I hope you gained some insight into
our thinking. Keep in mind that Enron is still viewed around here with
suspicion - something we all need to get over with.  I would not give up on
going to higher levels in the company to pursue business opportunities.  I'm
told through the grapevine that you made one attempt and got no response.
Take the energizer bunny approach.  Who knows where it may lead.

Wanted to make sure that you knew that today FERC declared the cap that the 
ISO Board voted out last week "null and void," which means that we're back to 
the old $250 cap.  FERC proposed a "soft" $150 cap that would take effect in 
60 days, however.  Call if you have questions.  Best, Jeff

My schedule has blown apart for tomorrow--traveling.  Possible to meet this 
weekend to discuss the project?  Either day's fine with me.  Apologies for 
the last minute change.

Best,
Jeff

Is there a suggested time for the meeting?  I'm pretty open.  I'd like to be 
sure that Jim and Paul and Mary Karen Denne can participate, too.  Do we need 
to have other commercial folks on the call (e.g., Calger, Belden, someone 
from EES (Yang and/or Benevides)?

are you and scott available this weekend to look at the place i'm thinking 
about renting in stinson for prentice's birthday?

thank you very much.

Sandi and Dave and Mike will dicuss further on the call on Monday but wanted 
to disseminate info regarding the meeting that Joe Ronan of Calpine offered 
on an IEP call today:

The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes.
Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants 
to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on 
board.
Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to 
consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later 
today)
One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting.
The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous 
"prudence" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts.
Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting.
Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an 
objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do 
worse, they take the hit.  The utility, under this framework, has broad 
flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.  (FYI:  
Coincidentally, I suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to 
the fact that it's already successfully in use on the gas side--during a 
panel discussion that I participated in yesterday at the California Energy 
Markets conference.)
The utilities told Rod Wright that they did not want, nor did they have the 
expertise, to get back into the generation business.

I have NO idea how I sent the email to jackie at kim's email address.  
apologies.  i'm losing it.  

did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project?  If not, do you want to 
meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss?  i'm in town.  just let me know.  
i can't find ted's email on any notes and i'm too lazy (flaky) to search it 
out.

I ran into Mike Florio at the CEM conference on Friday and upon learning
that he would be invited to the next Rod Wright-sponsored meeting, I asked
him about his positions on a number of the outstanding issues; as well as
his willingness to consider compromises on a number of the key issues.  Here

Hello everyone,

I thought I missed something last night - there were four accidents on my 
way home so I didn't even get into the city until 7:30 pm.  I checked my 
email and didn't see anything so I don't feel so guilty now.

I can meet on the weekend whenever.

See note below re:  Doug Condon.
Highlights of today's meeting:

Next week there will be a big push to get contracts signed from the First 
Energy customers from whom we received commitments.  There are approximately 
120 MWs of load we hope to sign up, using First Energy's Market Support 
Generation.  We also need to prepare a PR plan in case our contracted load is 
significantly less than our acquired generation.

Cinergy is being targeted as a new commodity opportunity.  The intent is to 
take advantage of the shopping incentive made available to the first 20% of 
load that switches when the Ohio market opens 1/1/01.

The Texas Commission's ruling allowing negative stranded costs will not yet 
be marked into the retail curves due to the uncertainty surrounding the 
decision.  

Personnel issues:

Mark Courtney is now the regional sales lead for Texas, replacing Jay Ferry.

Eric Letke is now the regional sales lead for California, replacing Doug 
Condon.

Yes.  You can expect it this weekend.  My apologies for being tardy.  Also, I 
think you should make a stab at getting Mike Kahn, Chair of the California 
Electricity Oversight Board on one of the panels.  I can make a contact and I 
don't think that it's too late to try.  He'd be very good.  Very close to the 
governor.

call me unreasonable.  i can take it.  been called worse, though, of course, 
coming from you, it hurts more.

chicken and egg problem--I think I'd rather try to stimulate customer demand 
for these products? (which in many applications are cost-competitive to 
purchased power, even with piracy stand-by rates of UDCs), and then 
simulanteously get/put pressure on reducing stand-by rates. So---your 
position, to answer your question, is unreasonable.

Nope, not at this point.? Rather than start with money, we'd rather start 
with getting the rules (i.e., the IOUs) fixed so that there ain't regulatoy 
roadblock after roadblock standing in the way of deployment.? Sound 
reasonable? 

so I see ENRON remains in support of PPP extension; what about using these 
funds to help buy down the costs (to consumers) of micropower technologies, 
such as customer-side of the meter fuel cells and microturbines? 

Don:? See attached from today's WSJ.

want to notify Calger, Belden and Thomas in Portland?

FYI.  How to remedy the "PX only" flaw in California's market has been on the 
table for some time.  I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a 
good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to 
the current framework.  

As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy 
Market conference last week.  The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also 
spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go 
up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other 
options--with him.  

My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the 
Wright meeting last week.  With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a 
very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for 
PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month.  It 
might come in handy as prep for the call on Monday to discuss the Wright 
meeting.

Here it is.

Given the emphasis from all quarters on the need for retail competition to 
make California work, would seem useful to strike a balance between the 
degree to which the comments emphasize wholesale and retail reforms.  And for 
the record, Sue, no I don't talk like that.

Gang,

I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments

This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take 
it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?)

I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of 
the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers 
to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some 
stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have 
some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally 
really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on 
demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS 
this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some 
customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after 
the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara 
-- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their 
operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail 
demand response.

This only goes so far, however...

The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids 
from the price caps.  SO, we need more...

I think we should focus on the practical effects of a "soft" cap (not simple 
and not certain) -- and how stable markets need stable price caps -- "soft" 
caps are not a stable price and do not send a stable signal for investment in 
new generation (the market may never know the real price since it doesn't set 
the MCP). The staff report provides some good evidence on why the caps are 
too low and we could also use the ISO's calculation of prices for short-term 
peaking capacity.  Then mention the issues Mary discussed below (information; 
cap mechanism bad for power marketers in particular)

Sue

	Mary Hain@ECT
	11/02/2000 01:03 PM
		 
In response to Jim's E-mail  - here's is my proposed list of issues for 
Enron's November 9 comments.  We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow 
so please comment on this ASAP.

We should discuss price signals including:
price caps and
market information

Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our 
comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing 
or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market 
information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took 
in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at 
all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they 
will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we 
should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment 
in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems 
for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet 
to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not 
addressed the problems created by OOM.

In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments 
could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell 
requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent 
governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection 
procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any 
clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the 
Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms, 
balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management 
redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral 
comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our 
written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's 
conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's 
decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues 
as we go.

FYI.  I'll be participating in a "round table discussion" on California next 
Monday on the Berkeley campus.  It's being sponsored by the Policy School and 
some folks from the Business School.  Laura Tyson and a former FCC mucky-muck 
(Howard Shalansky) will moderate the two panels.  Alums who now work in the 
energy biz are putting up funding for the event (e.g., Columbia, American 
Public Power Ass.)  We're providing a modest stipend.

There are two "round tables."  First one is "Why did we do this?," and the 
second one is "Where to from here?"  I'll be on the second panel.  Go to the 
attached website for agenda and other info.  I intend to pull from the 
messages, filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of 
the last several weeks/months.  I'll distribute talking points for review and 
comment sometime this week.  But please feel free to send thoughts, 
suggestions, etc. early and often.  

Best,
Jeff

Dear Colleagues,

The draft website is ready to go public. It has been linked to the gspp 
website. It is still the same address:

Marcie should be on the call.   Harry, et al. should also be included only 
the business units should be uninvited.  

FYI:

Sue stopped by and wanted to discuss your email re: launching missiles over 
email to the world.  

I told her that 1) folks are understandably sensitive regarding the info that 
gets to commercial folks, 2) she should continue sending those notes out and 
3) she should restrict the distribution list for such notes to GA, which 
gives the team a chance to discuss the issues and to decide what info to push 
out to commercial folks, and avoids rather everyone just willy-nilly sending 
out notes and potentially getting commercial folks whipped up into an 
(unintentional and  unnecessary) frenzy.  I think she took it well and I 
think she'll make a practice.  Only time will tell.

Alpert has passed both Assembly and Senate--on way to Governor.  6.5 cent 
cap.  Am faxing in case you don't have.  Jeff

Congratulations.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is refusing to sell outside of 
California for less than $250.  This is diminishing liquidity in the market.  
However, we can't call FERC and complain because munis are not regulated by 
FERC.  Here is an example of something we should be bringing to NW 
congressional members re why FERC should regulate the munis.

thank you.  if you get a chance, give a jingle and give me the brief rundown 
on where we left off on part 1.  thanks.

Gee, and at $120/bottle, I can load up on a few cases.  At that price, the 
Mondavi's must be hoping Bush wins so America can spend the tax break on that 
tasty Reserve.  (Kidding!)

Do you qualify for the discount on the Reserve, too?

GO RALPH!

1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 
(Exceptional) - Epitomizes Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape that is 
the backbone of America's most important wine district. Even at Robert 
Mondavi, which has produced its share of impressive cabs, the 1997 reserve 
stands out. The 1997 vintage was the best of the 1990s in the Napa Valley, 
yielding rich, concentrated red wines. Robert Mondavi Reserve's showy aromas 
of spice, cassis, and cedar make a strong impression in the glass. On the 
palate, the wine is deeply layered with pure dark-berry fruit flavors, has 
firm, ripe tannins and an ultra-smooth finish with superb length. ($120)

1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve - (91) Very 
tight nose, with blackberry, coffee and cocoa notes, this is a big wine that 
shows great intensity and depth. Quite closed now, the dark profile keeps its 
cards close to the vest. One thing for sure: this definitely one for the 
cellar. The finish is lengthy, with brisk tannins as well as espresso and 
bitter-chocolate notes. Hold for eight to ten years; this wine should keep 
till 2020. ($120)

"Plus je bois, mieux je chante" 

Greetings Wayne:

Sorry that I missed the last meeting.  I'll be attending by phone this week, 
but would like to attend in person as often as I can (understanding that our 
meetings will be weekly).  Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it 
might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.  That way I 
could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't 
permit me to do on Wednesdays).  If it's too complicated, don't sweat it; I 
can continue to do the meetings by phone.  But if Thursdays can fit into 
folks' schedule, that would be great.  Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff

Have you drafted any talking points yet?  I'm working on what I'll focus on 
for the conference at Berkeley next Monday and would love to crib from your 
comments.

FERC has not yet issued on the list of panel participants for the November 9 
conference, but we will circulate it as soon as it is posted on FERC's web 
site.  I did speak to Julie Simon at EPSA, however, and she told me that 
based on calls she has received all day from EPSA members, that it looks like 
FERC is mixing up the panels so that they will not be put together by market 
participant class.    Julie has heard that each panel will have approximately 
6 people, and each person will be given 5 minutes to make a presentation.  
Each panel will have 90 minutes total, so FERC is probably planning on having 
a significant dialogue with each panel after formal comments are made.

Also, Scott Miller called Julie today and told her that FERC is feeling 
somewhat beleaguered by industry response to the California order.  FERC 
feels that they issued a good order for marketers and generators, and they 
would like to hear positive responses from market participants at the meeting 
on Thursday and in the written comments on November 22.  We of course will be 
expected to state our positions, but Scott asked that we (EPSA members) 
temper our comments and recognize and praise FERC for the bold action it took 
in the order (on things like governance, buy/sell requirement, etc.) in 
addition to raising our concerns about the price mitigation measures.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We'll let you know as soon as 
we get the order for the November 9 meeting.

Sarah

and do you get the discount for the 97 Reserve?

I've tried to capture in the document Dave sent around on Friday, the 
preliminary conclusions/directions we came up with in today's meeting.  If 
I've mangled or missed anything, please chime in.  If folks have information 
(i.e., bullet points) to discuss at Wednesday's meeting regarding the various 
issue areas they're thinking about, please foward along to me by COB tomorrow 
and I'll compile for distribution first thing Wednesday morning.

Best,
Jeff

Do you mind if I meet with Carl and Severin and Rich next time I'm over at

Tomorrow at 4 EDT sounds good to me but I'm not sure we're ready.  I'd like to
make sure all of our sponsors like the idea of coordinating with IBER and 
UCEI.
What say you, sponsors?  The co-sponsorship decision affects our decisions on
place, topics, and speakers, becase IBER and UCEI would need to get involved
right away.

I spoke with Borenstein last night.  Shapiro's initial idea was exactly what
we're planning.  They appreciate and respect the fact that we've done most of
the legwork.  They'd like to be part of it and it sounds like they would
consider it a favor if we included them.  IBER has a subgroup called the
Competition Policy Center which is a program meant to exploit the incredible
concentration of antitrust economists at UC Berkeley.  I can certainly imagine
ways the school could benefit from a stronger connection with CPC and UCEI, 
who
are so widely respected and are doing public policy.  If Lee thinks its worth
potentially losing a bit of limelight on this conference for the long run
benefits of building resources and connections on campus, I'm all for it.
Rob

go right ahead and choose me as a reviewer.

Wayne:  If you insist, we can pass on Thanksgiving.  

Others:  Any problems with changing the meeting to Thursdays?  If the 
meetings are going to continue on a weekly basis, I'd like to try to attend 
in person as much as possible (i.e., schedule permitting).  Currently, my 
schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings.  But 
Thursdays would work.  If it makes things too complicated, not a problem.

Best,
Jeff

You're welcome.

Question:  re: "cat herding."  Do we have the participants list yet?  I've 
got a call in to Smutney (IEP)---Sue talked to him about the cap yesterday 
and I'm piling on today.  If we can give Smutney an alternative to "the $150 
cap's OK," then we can likely persuade him.  Tim: Be useful to know as soon 
as possible if the alternative Steve suggests below (i.e., >$150 bids with no 
disclosure) is palatable.  If other specific CA generators are participating 
on the panel, we'll need to know who they are in order to "assist" them with 
their price cap-related comments.

I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the "soft" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks.

Dave and I talked.  I've talked to Chris Foster (midmarket in Portland). He's 
sending me 1) illustrative examples of offers we've made to each of the three 
IOUs, 2) deals we've done with the IOUs to date (only one thus far with 
PG&E).  Laird Dyer will get back to me with the muni deals we've thus far 
done (e.g., Roseville.)

de nada

Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re: herding the cats.

In true "swedish hostage syndrome" fashion, Smutney informed us that none of 
IEP's members has screamed about the FERC-proposed cap.  He added that the 
"industry" is under siege and that "just saying no" to price caps isn't 
politically tenable.  He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price 
caps in his remarks.  We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head 
of California's generator association to avoid the topic.

We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal 
and offered the following message points:

Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again.
FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms 
necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for 
price caps altogether.
The most important reforms include:
Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to 
undermine "high" prices is easy entry by competitors
Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases
Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e., 
similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs 
profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the 
benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works.  
The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" 
reviews of power purchases.
Creating a retail market
If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish.
FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed.
Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, 
efficient markets require peakers.
Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary.
Disincents energy efficiency.
IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the 
proposed cap.

Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us 
today and tomorrow.  If folks have comments on these points, or have others 
we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.

Best,
Jeff

I'm sorry, I'm losing my mind.  did you send Amber's address?  if so, i've 
deleted it. could you send again?  also, are you sure you don't want the 
tickets?  they come with free parking (it ain't the closest lot, but hey, it

Jeff:

Following is a summary of recent EPMI West Power activity with the 3 
California utilites

PG&E - EEI Master Agreement in place.  As part of their recent RFP, we 
completed 2, 50 MW,  5 year, sale transactions for peak hours at $58.40 and 
$58.70.  They are looking at EOL although they have not transacted on it.  
They call regularly for shorter dated quotes.  We deal with Claudia Grief who 
works in Joe Henri's group.  Overall, we have a very positive relationship 
and look forward to increasing business.

Edison - Almost finished negotiation of a EEI Master Agreement to allow 
transactions.  We are haggling about some credit issues, but expect these to 
be resolved shortly.  We participated in their only RFP.   They did not 
transact with us or, to our knowledge, with others. They got cold feet.   We 
work with Jill Horswell, Sean Baker and Bennie Wu.  Since master contracts 
are not done yet, and no deals have been completed, I would say this 
relationship is not as good as PG&E but better than SDG&E.  I would expect 
that we will be doing regular cash business by the end of the year.  They are 
looking at EOL.

SDG&E - We have participated in 3 RFPs and have not been successful.  We have 
been trying to sell them longer dated energy (5 years).  We believe they have 
bought from others but for small size and limited duration.  We work with 
Sharon Firooz.  We have sent them master EEI agreements and are not making as 
much progress in getting them to agree.  They prefer using the  WSPP contract 
rather than EEI.  We hate WSPP.  We will keep pounding on them until they see 
the light but it will likely take longer.  Plus they are far more skittish 
re: longer dated transactions thatn the other utilites.  This said, I would 
be surprised if we were not transacting with them on shorter term deals by Q1 
2001.  They are not using EOL.

Please let me know if this summary meets your needs 503/464-3822.

Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re: herding the cats.

In true "swedish hostage syndrome" fashion, Smutney informed us that none of 
IEP's members has screamed about the FERC-proposed cap.  He added that the 
"industry" is under siege and that "just saying no" to price caps isn't 
politically tenable.  He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price 
caps in his remarks.  We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head 
of California's generator association to avoid the topic.

We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal 
and offered the following message points:

Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again.
FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms 
necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for 
price caps altogether.
The most important reforms include:
Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to 
undermine "high" prices is easy entry by competitors
Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases
Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e., 
similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs 
profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the 
benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works.  
The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" 
reviews of power purchases.
Creating a retail market
If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish.
FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed.
Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, 
efficient markets require peakers.
Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary.
Disincents energy efficiency.
IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the 
proposed cap.

Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us 
today and tomorrow.  If folks have comments on these points, or have others 
we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.

Best,
Jeff

plz chk email re: conversation w/smutney on price caps.  best, Jeff

To help herd cats, might be useful to get to the generators via multiple 
contact points.  My understanding is that the Houston-to-Houston contacts are 
good ones. We'll continue to work it via IEP and generator contacts here in 
California.

Steve:

I'm not sure how far along you are with the comments, but California's 
insistence on micro-managing utility purchases is really standing in the way 
of developing a competitive, functional market.  The prospect of having Ms. 
Lynch in particular and the State of California generally as a counter party 
in every transaction is a huge disincentive for the utilities to transact.  
(Though the situation in California has now put the utilities into a "damn 
the torpedoes" mode and persuaded them to transaction despite the regulatory 
risk.)

Clearly, the first best answer is utility-out-of-the-merchant-function.  But 
given the political climate in California, we're likely to have the utility 
in the role of buyer, at least in the near term.  For the market to work in a 
structure with utility as buyer, the CPUC and California need to get out of 
the way. Otherwise, it's a never-ending quagmire.

A couple of PUCs ago, the CPUC set up an incentive mechanism for utility gas 
procurement.  Under that mechanism, a benchmark is set.  If the utility beats 
the benchmark, it shares the benefits with consumers.  If it does worse than 
the benchmark, it shares the pain with consumers.  It's a model that works, 
that's simple and that's compatible with competitive markets.  It ain't 
perfect, but it's head and shoulders above the regulator-as-counterparty that 
the current PUC has put in place.

Given the brief time you'll have, there may be other more critical issues, 
but this one is getting increasing attention out here in the land of lunacy.

Amber's address:? 25664 Carmel Knolls Road, Carmel, CA 93923.? She is 20 
years old on Sunday!. 

I wrote you because I am not sure if Prentice is getting e-mails. 

Remember that some of your stuff might still be outside if I don't remember 
to bring it in.? There is also a folder of pick sheets to take up to the dome 
and leave on my desk, so we have them when any of us are up there.

We'll send a card.? She's 19?? Well, if we have to, we'll take some 
tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too. 

Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road 
while my is doing my road at the end of the month??? He's going to fax me 
the estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.? To be 
honest, the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this 
guy is really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.? He's 
pretty willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to 
Rolls Royce-style road.? And if you want to take a pass, that's of course 
great, too.? I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a 
cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know. 

Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> on 08/31/2000 09:53:11 AM 

I don't know if Prentice will get the e-mail, Jeff - so could you try to 
help make sure this happens.? Sunday is Amber's birthday.? Since we will be 
at the Cubs game it would be great if you guys could send her a card. 

When you come to get your stuff, take all the tomatoes you want with you! 
Are you going to take Annie?

Steve:  Here are the deals and offers.  The desk is concerned about two 
things:

1) that we not make the specific of the deals/offers public.  They're fine 
with general statements like "the offers are below the price cap."

2) they have good relationships with the IOUs and the munis and are starting 
to do a lot of deal; as such, they expressed concern about any comments that 
might agitate them and make them disinclined to transact with us (sound 
familiar)?

If there's anything else you need, for if you have any questions about this 
material.  Don't hesitate.

Good luck.

Best,
Jeff

Talked to Bill Reed.  In his comments, he will say:

FERC should be more prescriptive.  Can't wait for a new board, made of new 
people, to act.  FERC needs to be more assertive--I told him we're all for 
leadership from FERC.
They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express 
concern about the CPUC's micromanagement of utility purchases--I told him 
we'd have a similar message on that issue.
FERC should "PJM" the California market--I told him we would differ 
significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and "merging" the PX and 
the ISO.
He said his comments on "refunds" would be "narrow" and would point out that 
the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific "bad actors" and 
that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our 
position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking.
I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner.  
He said that it sounds like a good idea.
I told him about our message on price caps.  He said that he would stress 
that price caps ought to be a temporary "fix," and should be removed just as 
soon as the market is "functional."

Steve: I told him he should search you out prior to the start of the panel 
tomorrow and talk more.

Jeff

We can also meet at my meager apartment.  Parking is difficult, although,
there is one spot on the sidewalk in front of my house that the neighborhood
has deemed a legal spot.  Do you have parking Jeff?

Either is fine with me!  

We can meet at my meager apartment if you like.  Around 7?

How lame is this e-mail...

(Did you complain about being on my team??)

Where are we meeting tonight?  I think I may have your case study...I have
someone's.

See you tonight,
Jackie

Jackie,

We have changed your team assignment for the Mid Program Academic
Retreat.  You were assigned to Atlantic 5, but that team had more members
than any other and we needed to reshuffle to achieve some parity.

You are now assigned to Atlantic 4.

This means that your Pre-Meeting will occur on Tuesday, and not Wednesday.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns that
you may have.

Thank you,

Meg St. John

Market Surveillance Committee report is smallest file, oldest doc (August), 
and probably the best message from our prespective, particularly the 
solutions.  PX report is the biggest file and the newest (11.1.00).

OK, here's the list:

Mondavi's always a classic, and up the hill is La Famiglia (Mondavi brand 
that's a sweet view, great place to have a picnic lunch, and it has some neat 
brique-braque.
Hess collection.
Sterling.
Jarvis--truly amazing (and ostentatious--wait till Beth sees the woman's 
restroom!) But you must call NOW to try to get in.
Cordonui (sparkling wine) also has a very lovely view.
Stag's Leap.
Up valley (Calistoga way) is Chateau Montellana (sp?), which has really 
wonderful wine.
Finally, if you would like, I might be able to tap into a connection and get 
you in at Opus (Mondavi--maybe one of the best wines, dare I say, anywhere).  
Please let me know if you'd like to do Opus, and I'll get on it pronto.  And 
if you want to do Jarvis, call now!

Hess Collection.  Opus.  Sterling.  Mondavi.  Jarvis (if you can get in).

Greetings Folks:

As you know, the Gas Accord is coming to an end and PG&E's trying to figure 
out where to go from here.  I would argue that what happens with PG&E is 
equally, if not more, important as what happens with SoCal.  

As you also know, we're faced with a retrograde PUC that, by all accounts, 
longs for the "halcyon days" of command-and-control regulation.  As such, I 
think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the 
effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement.  

In that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed 
experts.  I think we should employ that approach again.  I asked Mike Day, 
who I think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal 
settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the PG&E case.  Mike's 
proposal is attached.  Finally, if there's anyone else you think we ought to 
include in our coalition, please let me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:

   Goodin, MacBride is willing and able to represent a coalition of
end-users, marketers, and other interested parties in the PG&E Gas Accord II
proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in
the GRI proceeding in both PG&E and SoCalGas settlements.  We would propose
to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between
the parties who agree to join such a coalition.  In exchange for joining the
coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of
settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to
reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the
GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide
any other useful information.  

   I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the
proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and
other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc.
However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with
Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead
partner on the case.  I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys
who would likely have some involvement in the case.  Because the majority of
this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly
fees.  However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition,
and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing
clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all
participants in the coalition.  With this discount, these would be the
lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.

   I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this
proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the
proceedings will be.  Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we
collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in
the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful
budgetary estimates.  If you require some type of estimation sooner than
that, please let me know. 

   Thank you for your interest in using our services.  Please contact
me directly at (415) 765-8408 if you have any questions.

Article appeared on Energy Insight's web.

Energy Commission Committee Recommends Moss Landing Licensing 
A California Energy Commission Siting Committee has recommended that Duke 
Energy's proposed 1,060 MW Moss Landing Power Project located in Monterey 
County should be given full Commission approval. 

The Moss Landing Siting Committee recommends the plant be approved for 
construction and operation at the existing Moss Landing Power Plant site that 
was previously operated by PG&E for approximately 50 years. According to the 
Committee, the Moss Landing project is entitled to certification not only 
under local ordinances and regulations but under the Warren-Alquist Act and 
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), based upon evidence 
presented at formal public hearings. 

The Committee has specified that Duke Energy will pay $7 million to support 
steps that mitigate the impacts of the power plant's operations on the area's 
marine biology. The $500 million Moss Landing Power Plant Project is a 
natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant to be located near the Moss 
Landing Harbor. The Commission began its review of the project in August 
1999. 

The proposed project is scheduled to be on-line by summer of 2002. If 
approved, the project will increase the total generating capacity of the Moss 
Landing plant to approximately 2,590 MW. 

Thanks.  Will do.  It's going to be a long haul.

Hi.  Nice to see you in Houston.  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on 
Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points you circulated on 9.28 
regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken 
Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); 
and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are 
there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the 
talk?

Finally, rest assured, you're the best resource anyone could hope for on gas 
issues anywhere in Enron.  If it seems like I've bugged you less recently 
it's because 1) I feel like I've bugged you a lot--too much--over the past 
couple of years and don't want to wear out my welcome and 2) with the 
electricity crisis in California and the start-up of Broadband, my attention 
has been less focused on gas.  Though that will change soon, since as you may 
have heard, PG&E's "Gas Accord" is coming to an end and we've got to figure 
out where to go from here.  (You'll be hearing from me in the near future on 
that issue, since I'll need to get a company-wide view of what we want to 
happen out here in the West.)

Look forward to seeing you again real soon.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Ms Carson:

I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the 
message points that Shelly Corman circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas 
prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas 
presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil 
Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there 
other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the 
talk?  And are there any recent analyses by CERA, PIRA etc. about gas 
nationally, in the West, and in California that you could forward.  And if 
you get a chance, could you give a ring?  I've got a couple of questions.  As 
always, greatly appreciated.

Thanks a bunch.

the hard copy i have (it's from the "media binder" developed for our offsite 
at the Woodlands on 9.19.00) has the number JN-2080039.  it's from gil's

Agghh!

Tried to protest the move, saying that I couldn't make it to the Tuesday
meeting, so she switched me to yet another team - which I will not mention -
that couldn't have been worse if I had hand picked it.  So I told her that a
phone call came in that confirmed I could change my plans and I am back to
the second team - with Courtney, Kimberley, and Anil Sama.  It's a good
team, though not as good as my first!  :)

Oh, well!

Mark:
Faced with the price spikes in California, the new administration led by 
Governor Davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation.  Perhaps the 
administration's (and its California PUC) hostility represents a 
"placeholder" until the administration comes up with it's own plan to "fix" 
the mess that California refers to as a "market."  As such, there hasn't been 
much coming out of the California PUC other than rhetoric regarding the fact 
that Republicans, not Democratics, restructured California's market and the 
desire to go backwards to good 'ol cost-of-service, command-and-control 
regulation.  However, the ISO and the PX have issued interesting reports, 
which I'll forward in a seperate email.  I look forward to seeing Prof. 
Littlechild at the conference on Monday.  He's on the first panel, I'm on the 
second.  I've attached the URL for info on the conference.

HEADLINE: "Perfection in California" 
AUTHOR: Wilfred Wong 
SUMMARY: 
Recommended: 
1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be that 
elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, 
I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and 
for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using 
non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of 
perfection. Could this wine finally be the one? This just released Opus One 
may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle 
(barrel samples don't count). Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One 
magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, 
fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of 
perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web 
of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% 
Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit 
Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is my top wine of 
the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130)

darling.  please.  don't taunt me.  i'm now too flustered for words.

got your page and voicemail.  been wrapped up ALL day.  i'll try to call

proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and
other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc.
However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with
Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead
partner on the case.  I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys
who would likely have some involvement in the case.  Because the majority of
this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly
fees.  However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition,
and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing
clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all
participants in the coalition.  With this discount, these would be the
lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.

   I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this
proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the
proceedings will be.  Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we
collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in
the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful
budgetary estimates.  If you require some type of estimation sooner than
that, please let me know. 

   Thank you for your interest in using our services.  Please contact
me directly at (415) 765-8408 if you have any questions.

OK, the tours are booked (it ain't much anyway).  But you're on the guest 
list for a complimentary OPUS tasting (see previous note).  OPUS is across 
the street from and just south of the main Mondavi winery.  When you get 
there, check in with the concierge, who will have your name and will set up 
with the complimentary tasting.  It gets real crowded sometimes, which causes 
them to close the gates.  If that occurs, you simply need to buzz the 
intercom and give them your name and they'll let you in and set you up.  You 
should really do the tasting----the wine is simply awe-inspiring and it's a 
cool place.  Finally, they're open from 10:30-3:30.  Later it gets, crazier 
it gets.  I suggest you try to get there around 11:30, which will ensure that 
you get the attention you deserve.

Have a great time.

Best,
Jeff

I haven't received an email from you about tomorrow's meeting.  
Unfortunately, I need to reschedule.  I apologize---you may have read in the 
papers about the electricity "crisis" underway in California.  It's taking up 
a considerable amount of my time these days.  I would be happy to reschedule 
for next week.  Wed-Fri.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

John:

We must thinking alike.  I just sent you a note.  I apologize, but I need to 
reschedule.  Monday and Tuesday of next week don't work, but Wed. thru Thurs. 
do.  Just let me know what works for you.  Again, my apologies, and I look 
forward to meeting next week.

Monday--Morning office; Afternoon--UC Berkeley participating in roundtable on 
California electricity crisis
Tuesday--AB 1890 implementation group--presentation on gas issues in 
California
Wed--In office
Thurs--in office
Fri--in office

Greetings:

Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is 
going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC 
hearing that took place today.  We've been invited to attend.  Focus of 
hearing:  Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather 
than FERC's.  Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing, 
Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.  

Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of 
participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's 
committee---and whether Steve Kean can be persuaded to come to California?  
Or perhaps we can send a video-tape of Steve to be played to the Committee?  
("You people in California are crazy, but other than that you're a swell 
group of people.") 

If possible, we would like to have the call at 10 AM (CST)/8 AM (PST).  
Please let me know if this works for folks.  And if it does work, Ginger 
could you set up a call-in number?

Best,
Jeff

This schedule is correct.

you're very welcome.

Greetings Diane:

Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical 
difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.  I'll keep trying!  

In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 
1-unit courses.  I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for 
Management).  When do I need to sign up by?  Thanks.

Just talked to Sue re: yesterday's meeting and before I shoot myself in the

Unbelievable....   In any case, congratulations.  Sounds like, all in all, it 
was a good meeting.

Scott:  has Oregon figured out who they voted for yet?

Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the 
hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we 
intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a 
solution that works for everybody.  Amen.

thank you very much.  i left a message on her voicemail.  that oughta do for

Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday.  
If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL:  
http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.

I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?"  I've been asked to 
identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the 
solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).

There are two documents.  One is a document that I previously distributed and 
used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week.  The 
other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.  I have 5-10 
meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the 
"facilitator."

All comments are appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

That's a great idea, and I think that it would be useful to meet with her.  
In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators 
as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.  I'll 
look into setting up a meeting with her.

Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is 
still the best way to go.  And if it weren't for the for the 
"undercollection/refund" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move 
ahead.  

Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's 
likely to be where the hearing goes.  She's been unable in past to control 
Peace at her hearings.

Does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a

front of people they will modulate their approach.

Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil 
and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that 
includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I 
suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. 
that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal 
issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing 
something, please let me know.  Thoughts?

Neil Bresnan and Jubran Whalan are in Dennis Benevides' group and are

brought into all the loops on how we are handling wholesale issues in 
California.  They are somewhat disturbed that they are not getting the same 
access to information and influence as ENA West Desk.  I know I have 
underestimated their need for independent involvement, but can we immediately 
start involving them in everything  - through e-mails, conference calls, 
request for comments, etc.

Jeff - could you call me with any particular strategy you think we should 
follow here - meetings or whatever.  Thanks.

DJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(This article was originally published Thursday)

     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission 
likely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall 
profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and 
customers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.

     A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating 
the wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the 
"expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done."

     "Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court 
to decide if generators should refund money," the commissioner said. "I don't 
think the state is willing to spend the money or the time."

     In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison 
International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit 
Pacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their 
ratepayers, the commissioner said.

     A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added.

     Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support 
having generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The 
commission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's 
troubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence 
that would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to 
documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.

     Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate 
the market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said 
rates were "unjust and unreasonable."

     The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also 
concluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in 
order to drive up wholesale power prices.

     The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to 
pass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers.

     The commissioner said "if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the 
utilities would be left holding the bag."

     PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale 
power. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a 
state-mandated rate freeze.

     As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive 
Officer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover 
more than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay 
off employees and reduce major capital spending.

     PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow 
the utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers.

saves 20$).? also, please let me know when you've confirmed with the G.O. 
that 
you don't want to do road, so that I can tell Jeff.? And of course we'll pick

how's

If Karen thinks it would be useful to have the PR firm go and report back, 
that's how we'll handle it.  Otherwise, we'll get reports from others.  Other

We discussed this with Rick and Jeff when I was in Houston last week.  FERC 
made it clear at the hearing on the 9th that the SD hearing was for people 
who could not make it to Wash DC.  So, we thought it unnecessary for Enron to 
seek to speak.  We thought, instead, that an observer might be appropriate.

 - Senate Energy1.doc

Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday. 
Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.  Mike has now come so far 
as to push the "core/noncore" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you 
just wait long enough, people come around).  Dan Richard did not object.  I 
am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.  Dan Richard said things like:

I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility 
should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act 
as a "quasi-governmental" body offering reliable, low cost service to small 
customers.
I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive 
market willy nilly.
People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of 
the "good" power, leaving the "dregs" for small customers.

While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but 
there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening 
that we should try to exploit.

In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas 
model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of 
attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the 
utility live or die by the benchmark.

There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of 
uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the 
Legislature will get on board.

Best,
Jeff

ARM had a good meeting with Mike Florio, TURN, on Friday on defining the
utilities default role and more rationale to the forward contracting.  My
walk away was as follows:

1.  TURN agrees with the big guys out first, and the utilities default role
defined to residential and small commercial customers.  Where you draw the
line (20 kW, 50 kW or 100 kW) is probably debatable.

TURN thinks SDG&E will be receptive, PG&E is thinking along similar lines
and that SCE is most resistant, but could be coaxed.

He thinks that CMTA/CLECA probably don't like it, but they will be in the
minority.  He met w/ John Stevenson, Governor's staff, who was receptive,
as was Carl Wood.

2.  He agreed that you need definition of the utilities default role to
provide direction on forward contracting.  Although, we all recognized that
the rules around reasonable behavior were preventing utilities from
entering into contracts.  We discussed up-front reasonableness.  Mike
seemed to be warming to the virtues of a competitive bid process in
determining a reasonable price.

3.  The idea of competitive default provider may need some proving.  He
felt SDG&E was the best place to start.  Michael Shames, UCAN, seems
interested in the idea.

4.  An important component of default service, at least initially, is
certainty of price for small consumers.  We discussed different ways of
providing certainty.  The utility could set a price, up front, and have to
manage its costs to meet that price.  No balancing account.  Utilities at
risk/reward.  We also discussed ways to keep the utilities honest on the
price.  One way is competitive default provider.  Another way is
competitive bid for portions of its portfolio.

5.  Discussed three components of utility procurement:  existing
generation, forward contracts and spot purchases.  Existing generation
would be valued.  Question about whether market prices would establish
price of output or some interim revenue requirement, as proposed by SCE on
its hydro resources.  Mike also seems to have softened over future
divestitures so long as there is some kind of interim buy-back contract
with the utility.

Will be at AB 1890 Implementation Group Meeting Tuesday and Wednesday
talking to other parties.

Can we try Friday at 10 am, again?

As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in 
my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those 
statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded, 
diversity-loving hipsters.  I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any 
sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to.  
Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about 
it.  Guess I've mellowed.  Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.  (I've 
come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially 
libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.)

Dude,

Thanks for the abalone last night. Too bad we had to wash it down with that 
discussion. Actually, wasn't so bad, really -- just a bit frusterating. 
Anyway, let me know what I can do for Prentice's birthday. Do you want me to 
go out there and check it out? Let me know about deposits and stuff like 
that as well.

I'm sitting here in the new place in the 'Loin listening to that great 
Mingus disk you got me. It's really amazing, a perfect compliment to sorting 
out and organizing all my papers.

Hope you're having a good day.

Scott

fyi... transcript of Gov. Davis' remarks in San Diego today.
 - GOVERNOR DAVIS CALLS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION TO ORDER 
CONSUMER REFUNDS AND PRICE CAPS.htm

Love to join.  Thanks.

FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity 
group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring 
legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the "AB 1980 Implementation Group" (I 
heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group 
includes just about all of the interest groups in California.  

I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a "real" market that 
California should look to in order to fix the "artificial" and failed 
electricity model created by AB 1980.

Jeff

On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

FYI.

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and "Hot Button" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

FYI. The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts. May be part of Davis' attempt to "re-negotiate" the contracts.  There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified.

Sue will take the lead on the ARM filing.  Let's discuss further the idea of a separate Enron filing--pros and cons to each.  Sue and Jeanne Bennett discussed and thought coalition filings would be preferable, but let's talk about it.

Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball. I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..

Further to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest. 

BT 

I'll give you a call and fax you some materials that Edison uses to justify their position.

I don't understand the netting that you are referring to.  Does it mean that they will pay negative ctc's up to some just and reasonable amount and anything above the j&r level will be paid out when all of the other people are paid.  How do they define the "ESP's share of the undercollection?"

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. 
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. 
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only. 
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) 
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed. 
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. 
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. 
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue. 

If you have any questions, let us know.

Jeff

Let me see what I can do.  So this is all about sourcing, or are you aiming higher?

The pilot is with the sourcing group within Energy Services.  The first
event should launch this week or next.  All ahead of schedule because our
professional services team got stuck in Houston with the WTC tragedy and
just continued working on the project.  I have heard that Enron is VERY
happy with the pilot and intends on introducing our application all over
Enron.  Our Sponsor is Dick Leibert-VP of Sourcing Risk Management for EES.
The project lead is a manager named Rudy Sutherland-he's been here for 6
years and knows everyone.  He's a character and a really good proponent.

I was hoping to have the meetings with Deal Bench this week, but that
probably won't happen.  How about October 4th?  It looks like that's a date
that works for both Ian and me.  Will that work for your deal bench guy?

Thanks so much, Jeff.

In what time frame are these decisions looking at being made?  keep me posted on the July 1st roll back since it would have the biggest implications for EWS/EES existing positions.

Thank you,

Cc:     Alamo, Joseph 
The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch. 
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers. 
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1. 
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter. 
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.

Sorry.  Haven't been around.  I definitely want to move forward.  I'll respond more fully if more is needed, but the short of it is, I'd like to do the entire job except for the decking.  Ready to start when you are.  Can you tell me what you expect the total to be (labor + materials), understanding that it's an estimate and not a firm price.  Also, I'm assuming that the cost for the materials that you quoted include the "bridge" to the cabin?  Will, of course, want the bridge to the cabin planked.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Really appreciate your efforts.  Looking forward to getting started.  Hope all finds you well.

State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter

Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO
Times Staff Writer

October 20 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. 

Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. 

The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. 

Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. 

Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. 

California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. 

In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. 

But in what consumer groups angrily called a "jailbreak," Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. 

Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers

The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. 

However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. 

"Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers," said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. "Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers." 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the "stampede" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. 

"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis," Angelides said. 

And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. 

"The PUC first gave Edison their bailout," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. "Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place." 

But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. 

Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. 

The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. 

"If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve," Lynch said. "The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts." 

Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. 

The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. 

Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy

In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. 

If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. 

In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. 

But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. 

"I don't think it's real smart to tell you that," said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.

State lowers estimate of energy costs 
Consumers might see rates decrease

Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. 

Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. 

The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. 

"Circumstances have changed," said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. "Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market." 

Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, 

and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. 

But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. 

It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. 

At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. 

Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. 

The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. 

"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday. 

He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. 

But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. 

She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.

Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 

GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 

The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 

Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

Sweetie, what happened?  How'd you hurt your back?  So sorry.  And SO sorry that this isn't working out for anyone.  I really wanted to see you guys and REALLY wanted to ride.  Another day, I guess.  Take care of that back.  Herniated disks are bad, so take care.

Best,
Jeff

Hey gang-
Just back from the doctors and he said "do not go riding this weekend".
I am terribly disappointed but it wouldn't be wise. I don't have any
broken bones and it doesn't appear that I have a herniated disk--at this
point just a lumbar strain but he is afraid it will get worse if I ride.
I am sorry for the inconvenience and I will send Lari a separate email.
I hope the trip is wonderful. Please share the details.
Madeleine

Hi all,

Sorry that some of you won't be making it to Mendocino.  I talked to
Lari's
assistant Cynthia and they are not planning to exact cancellation
charges.
Cal and I are still planning an all-day ride on Saturday, and Pat and
Nora
will be joining us on Sunday for a four-hour beach ride.  Would love for
any
of you who are "on the fence" to join us for both days.  The Ranch would
like to know by Wednesday if possible.

Amy

Dear folks:
Hope all finds you well, given the circumstances.  I would very much
like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school
has started (last year!).  Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern
California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.  I'm going to have
to cancel.  If there are any charges, please let me know.  Hope to see
all of you very soon.  Be safe.

Best,
Jeff

that's really too bad, i hope you are still able to make it.  I am still
planning to go, but will definitely be riding only on Sunday and might
drive
up on Saturday instead of on Friday.  Lu, I'll call you after I talk to
Jeff
to confirm whether he's still going.
p

Hey guys--
It is my hope that you and your loved ones have not been directly
affected in the tragedy.

I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward. I am not
happy to report that my lower back has gotten worse and not better since
the accident in Hawaii. Sadly, I may have to pass on Mendocino. I will
find out more this upcoming week and let you know.

If I do have to cancel I would assume we should keep the Grandma's room
for Jeff & Lu. If there are any potential cancellation charges I should
pay to Lari please let me know. I have been looking forward to this for
so long, I am sad to think of not joining all of you.

I will get back to you by Wednesday.

Madeleine

Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:

Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight

Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?

Amy

Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.)
 
Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?
 
Best,
Jeff

Hi Elyse: 
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners 

This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments: 

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.

From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."

Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

Hey man, how goes it?  Does this mean that you'll be supporting its adoption?

Generally OK given the alternatives but need clarification on certain

even with the modifications?

Lad,

What does this do to the BCAP filing?

Folks:
Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with
SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks
feel about it generally.  Hope all is well.

The CEC just approved a report drafted by staff that states there will be adequate natural gas supply this winter for electricity generation needs.  It does qualify this statement by discussing where potential bottlenecks in delivery might occur and recommends actions to address the bottlenecks.  See below for a link to the report.

Energy Commission Report Projects 
Improved Natural Gas Supplies For the State 

Sacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000's average price, the specter remains of last December, when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates. Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.

The Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified "yes" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.

Nearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.

The newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.

"This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future," said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.

To help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.

Natural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

Jeff,
Thanks, in advance, for your help with this.  The project is a "Corporate Responsibility Stakeholder Perception Survey" designed to gather baseline information on how our stakeholders view the issue of corporate social responsibility in general, and Enron in that regard in our major markets US, UK and Japan. Stakeholders are defined as those who are affected by our business, can affect our business or have an interest in Enron - customers, suppliers, governments, regulators, NGOs, employees, shareholders, etc.

What I would like from you is which stakeholders you think are important to include from Enron Corp's perspective here in California, and the job title or name therein. Please just take 5 minutes or so to list them, don't spend any longer than that.

CPUC - who?
CEC - who?
any others... 

I already have the major environmental organizations, but if you think TURN or others should be included, let me know.

Thanks so much!
Catherine

Going down to Fielder's for a bar-b-que tonite, watch a little TV and get this thing settled.  Seriously, he and I have traded messages today.  When we hook up, I'm going to ask him when we can meet and get this settled.  I'll let you know what he says as soon as I hear back.

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his "legal and tariff guys" told him that "they're on solid ground"; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison "is right."
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or ("god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Possible to discuss briefly?

That ain't gonna do it, in my view.  We're going to need to be creative.  Figure what number we'll take and how we'll take it and get out.  Note that Edison is going to be very wary of showing any "preferential treatment," lest another creditor get wind of it and yank them in on an involuntary.  I'm going to call Tribolet and get his thoughts.  I'll let you know what he says.

I think you should go talk with them and convince them they should reinstate our credit.

knock 'em dead, buddy.  jeff

I'll check on reviving the unbundling, but I think they've begged off of that for now.  In their most recent BCAP, they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone.  You have that proposal?  And having SoCal buy for SDG&E seems somewhat likely.  I can check on that.
 
Best,
Jeff

I was talking to one of my customers yesterday, and they said that Southern California Gas Co. recently made a filing to revive unbundling of their system.  Can you tell me if that is true .  Also can you tell me what the status is regarding Socal Gas purchasing natural gas for the  needs of SDGE's customers.  My customers tell me that is probably going to happen as well.

FYI.  This should be interesting. 

Best, 
Jeff 

Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an 
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). 

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the 
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order 
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II" 
application.

*********************************************************************
Fallout in California
 

PG&E remains in bankruptcy 

The company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under FERC jurisdiction, leaving distribution under control of the California PUC

The California PUC and Edison reached agreement designed to keep Edison out of bankruptcy

On the heels of a failed legislative effort to return Edison to solvency, the California PUC has agreed to a rate plan to permit Edison to pay its creditors

The Davis administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the State's General Fund and pay for long-term power contracts

California used about $12.5 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $45 billion in long-term contracts

Unless California devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business, California could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis

California suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice

Fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide, the State decided to temporarily suspend Direct Access in California and force customers to remain with the utility

The suspension is very controversial, prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get Direct Access reinstated in California

 

Jean:  Pebble Beach sounds great.  Let me know when you can fit it in your schedule.  
 
Give me a call when you have a minute and we can decide how to arrange a meeting.  Greatly appreciate your help.

Yes, I have known her for quite some time.  She is the one who recommended me to Korn Ferry for the job that I have at Enron.  I will be happy to make the introduction.  Shall I make arrangements for a meeting in Pebble Beach???

Thanks.  Boy, am I glad I've sat on that '94 cab.  Wow!

Dude:
Please let me know all the various costs that you've incurred on our behalf and not been compensated for.  I know we owe you $65(?) dollars for the guitar.  Is there anything else?  Let's play soon.

Is there any question?  I'll leave to Steve to structure the deal.  As I recall, Montavano, Shapiro and I usually make up one team, but I'm willing to switch around a bit.

Zach Streight - he has both a business and technical background.  Other than Ross he is your best bet for someone historically familiar with DealBench that is still working for Enron Net Works.

Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets 

(Published Oct. 7, 2001) 

A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. 

Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. 

Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. 

Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. 

The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. 

Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. 

How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. 

However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. 

It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure. 

The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.

The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com <mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com>. 

If you're referring to the Tues/Thur call, we've talked some and thought we'd go to once per week with Sacramento folks having the option of callling in, since the Legislature's gone until January. You have thoughts on the Monday call?  That one may not be as critical anymore.
 
Best,
Jeff

Should we set up a different call schedule for CA given the new environment - maybe just once a week?
 
If we do, we need to send out a notice to the key business people.
 
Thanks

Thanks.  I guess Davis' people think that we'll back off if they put someone from Texas in charge.  Perhaps they're looking for someone who knows Pat Wood.  Be useful to find out if she knows him.

Jeff

I just sent you a fax of the information which I currently have in my possession regarding the ICSC Law Conference.   I have a call into Shirleen Glasin (the individual here in Houston who is putting together the PowerPoint Presentation for Laurie) to see if there has been any discussions regarding Jeff's portion of the presentation; i.e., whether there would only be one PowerPoint Presentation prepared wherein Laurie would present her portion of the discussion and then Jeff would pick up and finish with the deregulation portion of the discussion,, or if there would be two separate presentations prepared all together.  I have scheduled a meeting between Laurie and Shirleen for next Wednesday, October 10, 2001 at 2:00 p.m. (CST) to discuss the presentation(s).  It would probably be beneficial for Jeff to attend this meeting via telephone if he is available to do so.

no worries! I can call her...as a matter of fact, I did but hung up because I had to take another call! 

You're so kind!

I will fax them as soon as I get them.  I have already received a copy of the hotel reservations form from ICSC travel.

Any time.  Just call.

you around today?  I need to talk to you for about 10 minutes. kd

Greetings.  We ever hear back from Richard regarding whether we agreed to any time frame for delivering documents?

PS Remind me to thank Forbes for that great article (not).

sigh....

left a message for sanders.  can you believe that forbes article wasn't as poopy as it started out?  Mark yelled at the guy and the editors sliced it down.  it was vicious before...

Greetings.  We ever hear back from Richard regarding whether we agreed to any time frame for delivering documents?

Jeff

PS Remind me to thank Forbes for that great article (not).

Agreed.  Karen, can you and I talk briefly before you call Ken? Thanks.
 
Best,
Jeff

It's ultimately PR's call, but my vote would be not to extend. 

Cc:     
Just a reminder that the contract we signed with Ken Smith is set to expire at the end of October. Contract terms allow for renewal, or extension, by written agreement of the parties.  

Commencing on May 1, 2001 Enron agreed to pay Ken $4000/month at a maximum of 25 hours/month.  Hours worked in excess of 25/month are paid at a rate of $160/hour. 

Termination of the contract requires that Enron give Ken Smith 30 days advance notice.  
  
If we choose to terminate, I suggest that Karen Denne contact Ken by telephone and also provide written notice of the termination immediately (unless you all agree that we should extend the contract).

Please let me and Karen know how you want to proceed by close of business Thursday. Thanks 
  

Thanks very much.

Hey Jeff -see memo attached; it contains good quotes from the ruling on the key issues.  Let me know if you need anything else.  -Bob

Attached is a memo outlining key aspects of the recommendation issued by the assigned Administrative Law Judge in the above-referenced case.  The recommendation is now before the full Commission, which we expect will rule by mid-October.  Please call me if you have any questions.  

     

I'll be in the office very shortly.  My converstation with Fielder (SCE SVP I've been talking to about the PX credit) yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling:
 

he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the PX credit
he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires Edison to "cooperate" with the AG and the PUC in litigation against generators/marketers

I told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly.  He said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps.

Michael:  I call you soon as I get in--next 15-30 minutes.

 

Best,

Jeff

reliant guy, mike jines, called me about the deal with the cpuc. he thinks they will get injured and that sce will just continue the same path of doing nothing for the generators and the marketers.
he wants to talk mid-morning houston time after we've digested for our view.
with the settlement of the filed rate case, what does that do for us re the ctc claim? presumably they would pay as there would be no argument not to. am i in the right place? i hate to be too logical here. jeff saw your earlier email re your discussions but i've been in another crisis. need to decide what to do tomorrow, or, i realize, TODAY, AS IT IS NOW AFTER MIDNIGHT. michael, can you get with jeff early and start getting  our view as i finish the other crisis stuff first in the am???

come on, you're kidding, right?

Jeff - a business question:

SPECIAL NOTES:
=============

I just talked to Kip Lipper--works for Byron Sher, but Burton relies on him alot.  He's drafting the letter that Burton will send to Loretta re: what to do about DA.

I've given Kip the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued.  Kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them.
I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds.
I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.

He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.

There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev. req.  The reason:  no urgency anymore.  Let's take a little time and get it right.

Best,
Jeff

If it's possible to talk around 3 pm California time for about 10-15 minutes, that would be great.  Would need to get Jim and Rick on the call, too.  Don't break your back, but would be very good if we could arrange it.  Just let me know.  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:

Steve is out of town until Friday.  If you need me to track him down, just let me know.  

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his "legal and tariff guys" told him that "they're on solid ground"; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison "is right."
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or ("god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Possible to discuss briefly?

Best,
Jeff

Thank you.  I was trying to get the number from Barry.

I need to have the document into Rick by COB on Wednesday (i.e., 4:00 our time).  Don't yank my chain.  

What time on Wednesday? 

Attached is the strawman.  Note that the Sheet 2--drops participation to bare essentials.  Sheet 3 assumes a 40% budget cut from Sheet 1.   The deleted actions are different in Sheet 2 and Sheet 3.  

Jeff:  Please review ASAP, add the gas matters to Sheet 1, delete gas matters that are not essential in Sheet 2, and take a 40% haircut in Sheet 3.  Also add back any other matters that I have deleted that you disagree with, but make sure that Sheet 3 continues to meet the 40% haircut target.  Then send to Sue Mara for review.  

Sue:  Please review ASAP after Jeff.  I need to get this into Rick by Wednesday.  

Alan:  Please take a look and pass any comments along to me.  

will do.

Jeff -- I am going to be in an off-site with East power origination and can't be on the call, if you wouldn't mind letting them know and tell me how it goes.  Thanks.

Secretary of State Bill Jones Calls Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the PUC to DWR Unconstitutional

Transfer Would Eliminate Public Accountability & Oversight Authority of Future Rate Increases

SACRAMENTO - Raising questions about the constitutionality of transferring rate-making authority from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to the Department of Water Resources (DWR), Secretary of State Bill Jones today expressed his outrage at the prospect of losing all public accountability and oversight of California's electricity rate-setting process.

            The PUC is expected to vote on Thursday, September 20, 2001, to accept a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer that would transfer its ratemaking authority to the DWR.  

"Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis setting rates without public oversight?" asked Jones.  "The Governor's record on energy has been abysmal.  He has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's best interest to give Gray Davis and the DWR a blank check," said Jones.        

AB1X specifies that DWR be entitled to recover the costs of its energy purchases after advising the PUC of the costs.  Most recently, DWR has informed the PUC that their purchases for energy through 2002 will reach $12.6 billion.  If the PUC accepts the draft decision, DWR will now be the state agency making the determination of whether its own purchase costs are "just and reasonable."

            "Pure and simple it's a rate scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional.  If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the DWR," said Jones.

"As our state weathers this energy challenge and faces great economic uncertainty with a budget deficit looming in the future, never before has it been so important for the PUC to responsibly perform its vital oversight duties, acting in the best interest of Californians," said former Governor George Deukmejian, who joined Jones and past PUC Commissioner Stan Hulett today in criticizing the pending PUC action.

            As a former California Attorney General, Deukmejian also expressed strong concerns regarding the legality of the PUC's abdication of authority.

            "The PUC's power to review rate increases is a power expressly granted to it in our California Constitution.  The Legislature cannot simply delegate this power to another state agency by passing a simple statute.  This transfer of power can only legally occur if a constitutional amendment is passed and AB1X is not a constitutional amendment," said Deukmejian.

            Former PUC President and Commissioner Stan Hulett also raised serious questions regarding the shift of constitutional responsibilities from the PUC to the DWR.

"Even something as seemingly innocuous as relocating the PUC's headquarters from San Francisco to Sacramento would require a constitutional amendment, according to the opinion we received from former Attorney General John Van de Camp when that issues arose some years ago," Hulett said.  "A shift of responsibility of this magnitude would clearly and unambiguously require a constitutional amendment given the enormity of the proposal."

            Secretary Jones implored the PUC to suspend action on the draft decision until these extraordinary constitutional questions are addressed.

            "California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all our sakes, and for the future of our state, we must not allow that to happen," said Jones.

Remarks by Secretary of State Bill Jones Regarding the Unconstitutional Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the Public Utilities Commission 

to the Department of Water Resources

 

(As Prepared)

 

Good morning.  

 

Thank you for being here today.  . As you know, tomorrow the California Public Utilities Commission will be voting on an extremely important issue that will affect all Californians for years to come.   

 

The PUC will consider abdicating its ratemaking responsibilities to the Department of Water Resources based upon a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer.

 

I am here today because I have grave concerns that if the PUC adopts this decision, they will be violating a major provision of California's Constitution.  

 

As California searches for ways to deal with our continuing energy situation it is incumbent upon each of us to examine the ramifications - both short and long term - of every decision we make.  This past weekend the California Legislature chose not to bring legislation affecting the pending bankruptcy of Southern California Edison because many members of the legislature believed that the legislation was severely flawed.

 

 

Let's examine for a minute why this issue and vote will be taken tomorrow.  This decision rests wholly on the new rate scheme embodied in Assembly Bill 1X (AB1X.).  

 

Since January of this year, the DWR has purchased electrical power on behalf of cash and credit poor Southern California Edison (SCE), Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E).  AB1X granted this authority to DWR. 

                        

            AB1X specifies that DWR is entitled to recover the cost of these purchases, and that DWR is to advise the PUC of this amount.  DWR has recently estimated that it will require $12.6 billion to cover the costs of power purchased through 2002.

 

AB1X further stipulates that the PUC will approve rates, designed by DWR and paid by the consumers, to cover DWR's expenditures for its energy purchases. Under the law, as laid out in AB1X, DWR and not the PUC will make the determination as to whether its purchase costs of $12.6 billion are "just and reasonable" under the law.             

 

Pure and simple, it is a scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional. If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the Department of Water Resources.  

 

This is a dramatic and extremely troubling break from the current role of the PUC.  For decades, the PUC has aggressively performed the vital task of oversight, through public hearings, to ensure that rates charged California's electrical energy users are "just and reasonable."  Now, that indispensable oversight authority would be delegated to a bureaucratic state agency, the DWR, with no public oversight and no independent decision making authority.

 

Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis' setting rates without public oversight?  The Governor's record on energy has been abysmal and he has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's interest to give Gray Davis a blank checkbook.

 

DWR and Gray Davis would become the sole arbiter of whether the cost of their own energy purchases has been "just and reasonable." Through AB1X, the Legislature has diminished the PUC's role so greatly, that its function is to simply allocate shares of the $12.6 billion revenue requirement to the three utilities.

 

This is a classic case of the fox guarding the hen house - it must not happen.

 

The PUC must not vote to accept this illegal transfer of authority. The PUC must vigorously defend its role.  It must not allow the Legislature to abolish the crucial role it performs: reviewing the reasonableness of the overall purchase costs before they are passed along to ratepayers.

 

As I noted earlier, the reimbursement scheme set forth in AB1X is a violation of California's Constitution. The Legislature's attempt to strip public accountability for the reasonableness of rate increases from the PUC and give it to DWR is appalling.  Nowhere in AB1X is it specified what a reasonableness review conducted by DWR will now be. 

 

Will senior officials at DWR and Governor Davis gather at a conference table behind locked doors and declare their own power purchases reasonable? 

 

Will they hold public hearings and subject their expenditures of billions of dollars belonging to the people of California to the scrutiny of the people of California?

 

            Looking at their track record, the answer is no.

 

The PUC's power to review rate increases is not merely based on statute.  It is explicitly set out in the California Constitution. This is a very critical distinction. The Legislature cannot transfer or delegate this critical power by a simple statute. It can only be done by constitutional amendment. And AB1X is not a constitutional amendment. 

 

According to California Courts, the PUC "is not an ordinary administrative agency, but a constitutional body with broad legislative and judicial powers." Article XII, section 6, of the California Constitution states the general grant of authority for the PUC to fix rates.  

 

Section 6 provides:

 

"The commission may fix rates, establish rules, examine records, issue subpoenas, administer oaths, take testimony, punish for contempt, and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction."

 

Thus, "[t]he Constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities, including the power to fix rates, establish rules, hold various types of hearings, award reparation, and establish its own procedures." This is basic California law, reaffirmed time after time by our courts.  

 

These constitutional powers are based firmly on the authority to make factual inquiry into the reasonableness of the rates to be fixed.  In one notable case, PG&E v. Railroad Comm., the federal court reviewed natural gas rates set by the Railroad Commission, predecessor to the PUC.  The court discussed the duties of the ratemaking body to make sure that the rates it fixes be "reasonable." 

 

Because the PUC has the authority to "fix rates," it therefore has a corollary duty to make sure that the rates it fixes are reasonable.  

 

This must mean that there is a constitutional duty and right to examine the costs underlying those rates.  AB1X cannot alter or eliminate that duty.  AB1X also cannot strip the core component of any reasonableness review: the close and open-minded examination of those facts being used to justify a rate increase.

 

The Legislature cannot deny the PUC these constitutional powers.  

 

By depriving the PUC the authority to examine underlying costs in the exercise of its duty to "fix rates," the Legislature has improperly sought to modify, curtail and abridge the constitutional powers of the PUC.  To that extent, AB1X is invalid and unconstitutional.

 

            In a startling break with California's past history, AB1X allows DWR to retain title to the energy it purchases and then "resell" it directly to consumers. The utilities then collect the energy costs from their retail customers and return to DWR the portion of the revenues DWR has said it must have as reimbursement.

 

            By any other name, this is a tax. It is an enormous sum of money being paid out by the people of California.

 

            According to our courts, the power to set taxes is a legislative function.  DWR is an agency within the executive branch of government. 

 

            The California Constitution specifies that the powers of one branch shall not be exercised by another branch. 

 

The following example highlights the impropriety of the Legislature's delegation of authority to DWR to determine the reasonableness of its own energy purchases.  

 

            The Legislature assesses California's highway and transportation needs and then sets the rate for the gasoline tax. Drivers purchasing gas in California pay the tax, on a cents per gallon basis, whenever they buy gas. The Legislature cannot delegate to CalTrans the authority both to determine its own highway construction budget and to set a gasoline tax rate calculated to fund that budget. 

 

This situation is identical to DWR. The Legislature has directed DWR to purchase power, as it needs, at prices it is willing to pay. The Legislature has further directed the PUC to authorize rates, without any review to determine their reasonableness, in order to reimburse DWR.

 

The PUC cannot legally - and must not under any circumstances -- abdicate its responsibilities to the people of California.    

 

This is a decision based on the unconstitutional scheme laid out in AB1X, and it's unconscionable for the PUC to vote away its own most precious function: providing accountability for just and reasonable rates for the people of California.

 

For these reasons, I cannot urge in stronger terms that the PUC take the following actions tomorrow on the draft decision:

 

1.      Suspend action on the draft decision until the extraordinary constitutional questions are resolved 

2.      Seek immediate resolution of these constitutional questions by initiating a lawsuit against the Legislature and the Governor 

3.      Adopt regulatory and statutory changes to ensure that public oversight and accountability for just and reasonable rates continues

 

            California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all of our sakes, and the future of our state, this must not be allowed to happen.

Firms Push Edison Near Bankruptcy

Energy: Power generators ask firm to spell out how they will be repaid hundreds of millions of dollars for purchases under deregulation plan.

By NANCY VOGEL and JERRY HIRSCH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

September 29 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Five big energy companies owed hundreds of millions of dollars by Southern California Edison pushed the utility a step closer to bankruptcy Friday by asking Edison to sign an agreement spelling out how each will be repaid.

The companies demanded that Edison meet with them within two weeks to work out a repayment plan and implied that otherwise they would drag the Rosemead-based utility into Bankruptcy Court. Under federal law, any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined $10,775. The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact total is not known.

The letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edison's fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close. Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors, but has kept others waiting. Some power generators, in turn, have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy, although so far only Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea. And Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy.

The letter, sent by William Bates III, a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators, expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers. Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month, Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with $1 billion in debt to big power sellers.

"This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such," says the letter to Edison's private attorney, Thomas B. Walper of Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles.

"We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has" about an agreement to repay its debt, the letter continues, "but we don't want to waste anybody's time. Thus, as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating. . . . Please give us a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to that question.

"Of course, we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement," Bates wrote.

The five companies are Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Corp., Enron Corp. and Puget Sound Energy, which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state.

Edison officials refused to comment.

The frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday, when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its $14-million debt to the city of Long Beach, which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island.

Edison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed $1.2 billion.

"Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, which is owed $100 million to $200 million by Edison.

A spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant, which is also owed more than $100 million, sounded a similar note. "It is time SCE made clear when, how much and even if it is going to pay us," Patrick Dorinson said.

So far, other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy, believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct. 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edison's plight.

Davis, who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy, ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edison's debt.

Other Creditors Take Notice

Senate leader John Burton, (D-San Francisco), has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utility's $3.9-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners.

The letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCE's strategy of winning a legislative rescue.

"From our perspective, the days of luxury for Edison are over," said John Moorlach, Orange County treasurer. The county holds $1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan.

Moorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators, they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court.

"By doing this, the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first," Moorlach said.

But Jay Lawrence, spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE.

"We still want to see a legislative solution, and we are against bankruptcy," Lawrence said.

Edison provides electricity to 11 million people. It racked up the $3.9-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. The state's deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers.

By January, Edison's debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility. The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing. So far, the state has spent $10.7 billion on power purchases.

Edison's counterpart in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered the same financial squeeze in the state's dysfunctional market. PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April.

The generators' demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on $200 million in loans until Oct. 19.

Shares of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose almost 5% Friday to close at $13.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Could it be ours as well?

thanks so much. please call me at office.  best, Jeff

Just found out that the best way to reach Bob Lane is on his cell phone at: 415-713-4473.

Best,
Jeff

I'll give you a call.  Man, were you all over NPR or what with that Telco story?  Give my best to Tina.

Best,
Jeff

Hey Great to hear from you.

I CAN BE REACHED AT 415-713-4473 (this is my cell
phone and you can reach me on it anytime.)

I was just going to call you.  I just left the Yankee
Group and am looking for my next opportunity.  That
gig was just not working out for me and I decided to
move on. Tina and I are now living in Albuquerque NM
and searching for some new opportunities.  I'd love to
get back to California, but am looking elsewhere as
well.   

Hope all is well.  Take care.

Give me a ring sometime.

Attemps are still underway to persuade the California PUC not to suspend DA at today's meeting.
However, the best information we have at this time is that the PUC will suspend DA today, but will not suspend DA retroactively.
As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th.
In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed "revenue requirement" that DWR submitted to the PUC.

We'll report back with the results of the PUC business meeting as soon as we hear them.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Best,
Jeff

Thank you so much for this information.  It is EXTREMELY helpful to our efforts.  Thank you so much for the quick response.  I'll wait to hear for sure on the Chicago utilities, and hopefully on the California ones as well??  Again, thanks.

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Can you folks help me get the info on OFOs on the LDCs below to Colleen Sullivan, who is working with EES on this.  Thanks.  

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

It appears that Davis has officially called the Legislature back to try to address the Edison issue.  Appears they'll reconvene beginning next Tuesday.  We'll report back when we get additional information.  There are some rumors going around that they might meet and simply appoint a "task force" comprised of legislators to continue working on the issue.  Burton is reported to have said that he's telling senators who are on vacation that "this isn't worth cancelling a vacation over."
 
Best,
Jeff

Greetings.  Did you folks ever send a letter to the PUC?  If so, is it possible to get a copy?

Best,
Jeff

Given that 1) the PUC has quite a few important issues on its agenda and 2) the PUC meeting will likely coincide with our regularly scheduled meeting time, we'll reschedule our 11:30 AM PDT call to 3 PM PDT for today only.  

With the Legislature adjourned (thankfully), we'll re-assess the need for a twice-weekly call and get back to folks.  The potential for a 3rd extraordinary session may affect what we do.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call.

Best,
Jeff

So I'm assuming that you support the plan?
 
Best,
Jeff

I have a new description of PG&E's reorg plan-- it is the ultimate
expression of their longstanding affliction with Enron-envy.  Now that
they're cutting loose the UDC/LDC, they can fall flat on their faces with
no safety net (except the hydro, of course).   MIKE

You should contact Tim directly.  There is a tariff section on each website and a search function using key words.  The utilities issue reports on OFO incidents, and Tim should have those as well.  Let me know if there's anything we can do.

Best,

Jeff-
Should I contact Tim Hamilton, or have you already done this?  Also--if you could help me find where in the websites the information is, that would be helpful.  Is it just the OFO tariffs that are on the websites or is there actual data on how often they have called OFOs, when they were called, etc. also published?  We need all of that to better evaluate our risks/costs of serving those customers.  Thanks for your help.

Can you folks help me get the info on OFOs on the LDCs below to Colleen Sullivan, who is working with EES on this.  Thanks.  

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

This is a good starting point for now.

Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

Bet Mike ain't thrilled about not being the firm to draft this...How's it look thus far?    

For our call set for 3 pm CDT
Attached please find the draft Petition for Writ of Review before the California Supreme Court.  We are currently working on the Memorandum of Points and Authorities and anticipate sending a draft sometime tomorrow morning.  The Petition is based on the assumption that the Commission will adopt an order with retroactive application.  If the Commissions issues an Order consistent with the draft Interim Decision published today, then retroactivity will not be an issue and there wll be no need to seek judicial relief (at least on that ground). 
 
Enron Energy Services, Inc., is named as the Petitioner.  I am uncertain, however, whether this is the correct name or entity.
 
The Petition must be filed in the Supreme Court because the Legislature conferred exclusive and original jurisdiction on it when Public Utilities Code section 1768 was enacted.  The Petition does not  address the timeliness of the request for Supreme Court review.  Generally, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a Petition is timely and Section 1768 appears to require that an application for rehearing be denied before a Petition can be filed.  Since there will undoubtedly be an argument that the Petition is premature because there has been no application for a rehearing, the Points and Authorities (and probably the Petition) will discuss the timeliness of the Petition.  The exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine should control making the Petition timely.
 
Dan Douglass and I will be available for your 1 p.m. conference call.  If you need to reach me at any time my office number is (818) 596-2291, my cell number is (805) 796-2198, and my Email address is eduncan2@arterhadden.com <mailto:eduncan2@arterhadden.com>.  EWD

- those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension

- existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions

Suggest that we set-up a call on Mon or Tues. Would like myself, Angela Schwarz, Lamar Frazier, David Cox, Gayle Muench and Michael Mann in attendance

Oh joy.

Tim is gone.  Jess Hewitt and Kris Shireman have taken over that function, and they are the ones who are looking for the info.  Apparently they don't have it.

FYI.  You know if Tim's still at Enron?  I haven't heard from him for quite some time.
Best,
Jeff

You should contact Tim directly.  There is a tariff section on each website and a search function using key words.  The utilities issue reports on OFO incidents, and Tim should have those as well.  Let me know if there's anything we can do.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff-
Should I contact Tim Hamilton, or have you already done this?  Also--if you could help me find where in the websites the information is, that would be helpful.  Is it just the OFO tariffs that are on the websites or is there actual data on how often they have called OFOs, when they were called, etc. also published?  We need all of that to better evaluate our risks/costs of serving those customers.  Thanks for your help.

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Best,
Jeff

Thank you so much for this information.  It is EXTREMELY helpful to our efforts.  Thank you so much for the quick response.  I'll wait to hear for sure on the Chicago utilities, and hopefully on the California ones as well??  Again, thanks.

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Can you folks help me get the info on OFOs on the LDCs below to Colleen Sullivan, who is working with EES on this.  Thanks.  

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

See list of folks below.  I'll forward you another email with the name of Jeremy's asst., with whom you'll need to coordinate to get a call set up for later today.  Thanks very much for your help.  From our  side, please include Sue and Rick and me.

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff

u wanna go?

I suggest someone from Enron definitely attend.

It's out ...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE=09September 20, 2001
CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI=
ZATION=20
Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State =
Bailout
(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=
icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=
thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout," said Robert D. Glynn,=
 Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=
esident of PG&E Corporation.  "And, the plan will enable us to provide long=
-term growth prospects to shareholders." =20
The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =
into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=
her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =
and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=
m.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=
ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=
art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=
nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.
The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=
ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=
he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=
c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=
structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=
atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=
t of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=
ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=
sh and 40 percent in notes.
 =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =
Corporation will be organized as follows:=20

?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=
ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=
ts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=
f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=
0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=
ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20

?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=
iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=
c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=
y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20

The new electric generation business will be a California company establish=
ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=
ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=
s, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=
00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =
with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=
eping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=
ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=
pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20
