Classes for training and classifying instances.

 All classification techniques in MALLET are implemented as two classes:
 a trainer and a classifier.  The trainer injests the training data
 and creates a classifier that holds the parameters set during training.
 The classifier applies those parameters to an Instance to produce
 a classification of the Instance.
