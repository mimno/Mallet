Yeltsin PER
, O
hardly O

then O
gave O
an O

criticising O

as O
he O
clinched O
a O

But O
Chernomyrdin PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O

insist O
Lebed PER

playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O

that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan PER
Maskhadov PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin PER
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow LOC

Lebed PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O

who O
have O
profited O
from O

want O
it O

seize O

remove O

Maskhadov PER

the O

fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian MISC

in O

who O
sought O

blown O
up O

him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O

said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya LOC

future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O

something O

be O

finding O
that O

gap O

sides O

more O

WASHINGTON LOC
1996-08-28 O

The O
Securities ORG
and ORG
Exchange ORG
Commission ORG
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq MISC
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC ORG
Chairman O
Arthur PER
Levitt PER
. O

The O
SEC ORG
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O
SEC ORG
's O
division O
of O
market O
regulation O
, O
Richard PER
Lindsey PER
, O
said O
Wall LOC
Street LOC
firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC ORG
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O
, O
the O
SEC ORG
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O
malpractices O
on O
Nasdaq MISC
when O
the O
parent O
of O
the O
Nasdaq MISC

, O
the O
National ORG
Association ORG

, O
agreed O
to O
spend O
$ O
100 O
million O
over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O
brokers O
' O
trading O
practices O
. O

The O
SEC ORG
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O
prices O
before O
their O
orders O
were O
executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O
price O
improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O
bid O
" O
and O
" O
ask O
" O
quotations O
from O
exchange O
specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
who O
trade O
more O
than O
1 O
percent O
of O
a O
stock O
during O
any O
quarter O
on O
Nasdaq MISC
. O

The O
SEC ORG
's O
limit O

rule O
will O
mean O
a O
major O
change O
for O
Nasdaq MISC
, O
where O

The O
European ORG
Commission ORG
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain LOC
's O
mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU ORG
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission ORG
spokesman O
Gerard PER
Kiely PER
told O
Reuters ORG
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE MISC
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O

, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain LOC
and O
its O
14 O
EU ORG
partners O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE MISC
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European ORG
Commission ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE MISC
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely PER
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE MISC
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British MISC
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O
new O
infections O
and O
14,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE MISC
before O
2001 O
. O

British MISC

' O

called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O

this O

" O
National ORG

president O
Sir O
David PER
Naish PER

Naish PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain LOC
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European MISC

. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O

if O
in O

throughout O

accepted O
this O

, O
" O
Naish PER

The O

could O
well O
reopen O

which O
slapped O

The O

" O
I O
think O
the O

The O

Speculation O
that O

" O

Fear O
that O

the O
outlook O

more O

" O
Although O

someone O

it O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O

because O
the O

If O
that O

true O

then O
any O
